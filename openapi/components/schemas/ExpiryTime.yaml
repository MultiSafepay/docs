  The time until the login URL expires.

  To specify `expires_in` set the time with a unit. The format is:

  - Years to "y"
  - Weeks to "w"
  - Days to "d"
  - Hours to "h"
  - Minutes to "m"
  - Seconds to "100s"

  For example, "1y", "5m" or "7d".

  If `expires_in` is set without a unit, it defaults to `seconds.
type: string
example: 5m
