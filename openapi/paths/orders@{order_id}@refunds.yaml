    Process a [full or partial refund](https://docs.multisafepay.com/docs/refund-payments/) for an order.

    Refunding creates a new order linked to the original order. By default, it has the same `order_id` as the original order. To override this, include in the request `refund_order_id`.
  operationId: refundOrder
  security: [ApiKeyQuery: []]
  parameters:
    - name: order_id
      description: | 
        The unique identifier of the order. 

        To refund a Pay After Delivery partial shipment: 

        - Before shipment: Refund the whole order using the **invoice order** `order_id`.
        - After shipment: Refund specific partial shipments using the **shipment** `order_id` returned in the [Partially ship order](https://docs.multisafepay.com/reference/updateorder) response.
