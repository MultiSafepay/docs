            The <a href="/faq/payment-regulations/payment-service-directive-2">Payment Service Directive 2</a> (PSD2) is a set of laws and regulations established by the European Banking Authority.
            It aims to increase the security of online payments within Europe.
        </p>
        <p>    
            PSD2 requires <a href="/faq/payment-regulations/strong-customer-authentication">Strong Customer Authentication</a>
             (SCA) to ensure that online payments use 
            Two Factor Authentication (2FA). One of the protocols we use to meet this requirement is <a href="/faq/payment-regulations/3d-secure">3D Secure</a> (3DS).
       
        </p>
