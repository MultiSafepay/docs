            PSD2 Update
        </h3>
        <p class="pb-2">
            Starting January 1st 2021, the new <a href="/faq/payment-regulations/payment-service-directive-2">Payment Service Directive 2</a> (PSD2) will officially be enforced.
            PSD2 aims to improve the security of online payments within Europe. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            One of the requirements of PSD2 is the use of <a href="/faq/payment-regulations/strong-customer-authentication">Strong Customer Authentication</a>
             (SCA). This requirement ensures that online payments are performed with 
            Two Factor Authentication (2FA). The protocol used to implement this requirement is called <a href="/faq/payment-regulations/3d-secure">3D Secure</a> (3DS).
        </p>
