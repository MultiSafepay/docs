Your right to apply surcharges varies per payment method and the customerâ€™s country.
PSD2 The PSD2 applies to the whole European Economic Area (EEA), but individual states can decide how to implement certain aspects.</description>

      <description>The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) is a set of laws and regulations established by the European Banking Authority (EBA) that aim to improve consumer rights and security, while also promoting competition within the financial industry.
The directive not only enhances the safety of payments across the European Union, but also enables the development and use of innovative new technologies.
Strong customer authentication To help combat financial and data fraud, the PSD2 requires strong customer authentication (SCA) for most online payments in Europe.</description>
