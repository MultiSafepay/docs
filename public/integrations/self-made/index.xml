      <description>MultiSafepay uses a webhook to send updates about orders and other notifications to your web server.
You can configure the webhook at website level or at order level.
Requirements You must set a webhook endpoint, which is a URL that:
 Doesn&amp;rsquo;t include port numbers. Is publicly accessible, or has MultiSafepay on your allow list. Uses HTTPS - We don&amp;rsquo;t accept HTTP for security reasons.  For a list of MultiSafepay IP addresses, email integration@multisafepay.</description>

      <description>When there is an update to your order, we notify your web server at the following URL through a POST request:
{your-webhook-endpoint}?transactionid=12345&amp;amp;timestamp=140292929
This URL is your webhook endpoint combined with two additional parameters:
 transactionid: Your unique identifier for the order, previously set as order_id in your API request. timestamp: The time the notification was triggered.  The updated order details make up the payload of the request.
Check the status Check the order status in the status field.</description>

      <description>MultiSafepay provides a RESTful API that can be accessed by HTTP requests to manage your data. We support data in JSON format only.
The most important data element in our API is the order. Orders contain all information related to a single instance of products and/or services sold to a customer.
Orders can be linked to multiple transactions. A transaction represents an instance of funds being transferred.
The most common operation to perform with our API is creating an order.</description>

      <title>Validate HMAC signatures</title>
      <link>https://docs.multisafepay.com/integrations/self-made/handle-notifications/validate-hmac-signatures/</link>

      <guid>https://docs.multisafepay.com/integrations/self-made/handle-notifications/validate-hmac-signatures/</guid>
      <description>To validate the HMAC signature of POST notification requests in your own solution, follow these steps:
  Base64 decode the Auth header value of the request.   Example   Before: MTY0MTIxODg4NDowNmNiZjIyNmU3Yzg3M2VmZjk2OTIxZDdmZGUzOTk4ZWI2YmUwZGU3OTE1ZWUxYzFiNTE0OTUxMWZjYTgyZTI2YmIwYWIyZTZkMGUwYWQ5OTdjYmFiMTUxZTRiYTU2MTU0MThkOGUxMjUyODMwMTcyNjE0M2VkMTE0NjI4N2Y5Mw==
After: 1641218884:06cbf226e7c873eff96921d7fde3998eb6be0de7915ee1c1b5149511fca82e26bb0ab2e6d0e0ad997cbab151e4ba5615418d8e12528301726143ed1146287f93
    Split the decoded Auth header value using the colon (:) as separator.
 The first string is the timestamp. The second string is the HMAC signature.    Example   Timestamp: 1641218884</description>
