You **must** inform us of any of the following changes to your company information:

## Change of address

Email your new company address and your account ID (top-right corner of your dashboard) to <support@multisafepay.com>  

## Change in the company form, directors, or UBOs 

Email the new details and your account ID (top-right corner of your dashboard) to <risk@multisafepay.com>

We will request new documentation, such as [UBO statements](/docs/onboarding#4-identify-ubos) or copies of identification documents. 

## Company takeover

If a different company is taking over your account, we recommend opening a **new** account to separate the money flow. 

Make sure you update all company details on your [site(s)](/docs/sites/), including the registration number, VAT number, and address. 

The company details on each site must match the details in your account.
