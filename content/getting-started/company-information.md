You **must** inform us of any of the following changes to your company information:

## Change of address

Email your new company address and your account ID (top-right corner of your dashboard) to <support@multisafepay.com>  

To update your contact details, provide us with your address in your dashboard:

<details id="provide-email">
<summary>How to update email address</summary>
<br>

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
2. In the top-right corner of your dashboard, click <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MultiSafepay/docs/master/static/img/profile-icon.png"/>  > **Account information**.
3. Under **Contact details**, provide the relevant email address.
4. Click **Save**.

</details>

## Change in the company form, directors, or UBOs 

Email the new details and your account ID (top-right corner of your dashboard) to <risk@multisafepay.com>

We will request new documentation, such as [UBO statements](/docs/onboarding#4-identify-ubos) or copies of identification documents. 

## Company takeover

If a different company is taking over your account, we recommend opening a **new** account to separate the money flow. 

Make sure you update all company details on your [site(s)](/docs/sites/), including the registration number, VAT number, and address. 

The company details on each site must match the details in your account.
