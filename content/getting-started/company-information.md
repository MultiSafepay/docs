We will request new documentation, such as [UBO statements](/docs/onboarding#4-identify-ubos) or copies of identification documents.

## Company takeover

If a different company is taking over your account, we recommend opening a **new** account to separate the money flow.

Make sure you update all company details on your [website(s)](/docs/sites/), including the registration number, VAT number, and address.

The company details on each website must match the details in your account.

## Notification emails

You can add or remove email addresses to receive notifications about completed and uncleared transactions, invoices, and chargebacks.
