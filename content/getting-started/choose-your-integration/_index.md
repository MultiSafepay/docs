We support multiple [integration](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#integration) methods. Choose one that matches your business needs and tech stack.   

For help selecting a method, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

## Ready-made integrations
MultiSafepay's integrations developed in-house require fewer development resources and let you start testing straight away.

## Self-made integrations
Build your own integration, especially if you are developing a new ecommerce website or app. This generally requires more development resources, but lets you fully customize the look, feel, and functionality of your checkout experience.
