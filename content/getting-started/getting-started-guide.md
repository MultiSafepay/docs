Learn how to get started with MultiSafepay as your smart payment service provider.

# Create a free test account

Simply fill out a signup form, and then sign in to your test dashboard using the security code we email you.

**Full guidance:** [Create an account](/docs/create-account/)

# Set up your account

To set up your account, you need to:

- Add at least one [site](/docs/sites/) to your account.
- Activate your selected [payment methods](/docs/payment-methods/).


# Choose an integration method 

Choose an integration method that matches your business needs and tech stack.   
For help selecting an integration method, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

### Ready-made integrations  
MultiSafepay's integrations developed in-house require fewer development resources and let you start testing straight away. We have a wide range of plugins and apps to integrate with platforms like Magento, WooCommerce, Shopware, and Lightspeed.

**Full guidance:** [Ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/)

### Self-made integrations
Build your own integration, especially if you are developing a new ecommerce website or app. This generally requires more development resources, but lets you fully customize the look, feel, and functionality of your checkout experience.

**Full guidance:** [Self-made integrations](/docs/self-made/)

# Test your integration 

Before you start processing real transactions, test each payment method.

**Full guidance:** [Testing payment methods](/docs/testing/)

# Onboard your account

To start processing real transaction, we need to check and approve your company information.

- Complete the live account sign up form.
- Provide information about your company, including the ultimate beneficial owners.
- Check the list of prohibited products and services.
- Display required information on your site.

We then perform know your customer (KYC) checks. If approved, your account goes live.
