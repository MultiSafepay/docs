This page provides an overview of how to get started with MultiSafepay as your smart payment services provider.

For detailed information about each step, read the full guidance.

# 1. Create a free test account

Simply fill out a signup form, and then sign in to your test dashboard using the security code we email you.

**Full guidance:** [Create an account](/docs/create-account/)

# 2. Set up your account

To set up your account, you need to:

* Add at least one [website](/docs/sites/) to your account.
* Activate your selected [payment methods](/docs/payment-methods/).

# 3. Choose an integration method

Choose an integration method that matches your business needs and tech stack.\
For help selecting an integration method, email [integration@multisafepay.com](mailto:integration@multisafepay.com)

### Ready-made integration

MultiSafepay's integrations, which we develop in house, require fewer development resources and let you start testing straight away. We have a wide range of plugins and apps available to integrate with platforms like Magento, WooCommerce, Shopware, and Lightspeed.

**Full guidance:** [Ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/)

### API integration

Alternatively, you can build your own integration, especially if you're developing a new ecommerce website or app. This generally requires more development resources, but lets you fully customize the look, feel, and functionality of your customers' experience.

**Full guidance:** [API integration](/docs/api-integration/)

# 4. Test your integration

Before you start processing real transactions, test each payment method.

**Full guidance:** [Testing payment methods](/docs/testing/)

# 5. Onboard your account

To start processing real transactions, we need to check and approve your company information.

* Complete the live account signup form.
* Provide information about your company, including the ultimate beneficial owners.
* Check our list of prohibited products and services.
* Display required information on your website.

We then perform know your customer (KYC) checks. If approved, your account goes live.

**Full guidance:** [Onboarding](/docs/onboarding/)
