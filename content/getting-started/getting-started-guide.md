# 1. Create a free test account

Simply fill out a signup form, and then sign in to your test dashboard using the security code we email you.

**Full guidance:** [Create an account](/docs/create-account/)

# 2. Set up your account

You need to add at least one site to your account, and to activate your selected payment methods.

**Full guidance:** [Manage my account](/docs/manage-account/)

# 3. Choose an integration method 

Choose an integration method that matches your business needs and tech stack.   
For help selecting an integration method, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

## Ready-made integrations  
MultiSafepay's integrations developed in-house require fewer development resources and let you start testing straight away. We have a wide range of plugins and apps to integrate with platforms like Magento, WooCommerce, Shopware, and Lightspeed.

**Full guidance:** [Ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/)

## Self-made integrations
Build your own integration, especially if you are developing a new ecommerce website or app. This generally requires more development resources, but lets you fully customize the look, feel, and functionality of your checkout experience.

**Full guidance:** [Self-made integrations](/docs/self-made/)

# 4. Test your integration 

Before you start processing real transactions, test each payment method.

**Full guidance:** [Testing payment methods](/docs/testing/)

# 5. Onboard your account

To start processing real transaction, we need to check and approve your company information.

- Complete the live account sign up form.
- Provide information about your company, including the ultimate beneficial owners.
- Check the list of prohibited products and services.
- Display required information on your site.

We then perform know your customer (KYC) checks. If approved, your account goes live.

**Full guidance:** [Onboarding](/docs/onboarding/)
