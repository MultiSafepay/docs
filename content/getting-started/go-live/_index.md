To begin processing real transactions, [sign up for a live account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup).

MultiSafepay is a [payment service provider](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-service-provider-psp) and [acquirer](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#acquirer), so we are legally required to perform know your customer (KYC) checks.  

{{< details title="About KYC checks" >}}

You need to provide information about your company structure, and your products and services. We then perform KYC checks on the:

- Account holder
- Business bank account
- Merchant
- Website

To help you start accepting payments as quickly as possible, we divide our KYC checks into two phases:

- **Identification:** When we have established the identity of the account holder, you can start accepting payments.
- **Verification:** When we have verified the identity of the account holder, you can receive payouts to your business bank account.
