When you are ready, [sign up for a live account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup) to begin processing real transactions.

MultiSafepay is a [payment service provider](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-service-provider-psp) and [acquirer](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#acquirer). Therefore, we are legally required to perform know your customer (KYC) checks on your account. You can supply the information we need to activate your account through your MultiSafepay Control. 

To learn more, read our documentation about [onboarding](/faq/getting-started/onboarding/).

If you need help creating a live account, email our Sales Team at <sales@multisafepay.com>
