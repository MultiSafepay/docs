## 3. Choose an integration method 

Choose an integration method that matches your business needs and tech stack.   

### Ready-made integrations  
MultiSafepay's integrations developed in-house require fewer development resources and let you start testing straight away. We have a wide range of plugins and apps to integrate with platforms like Magento, WooCommerce, Shopware, and Lightspeed.

### Self-made integrations
Build your own integration, especially if you are developing a new ecommerce website or app. This generally requires more development resources, but lets you fully customize the look, feel, and functionality of your checkout experience.
