To set up your test account, you must first add at least one website and generate an [API key](/getting-started/glossary/#api-key). 

{{< details title="Website requirements" >}}

You can add an unlimited number of websites to your MultiSafepay account, but they must all be operated by the same legal entity linked to that account.

To process payments from a website operated by a separate legal entity, you must sign up for an additional MultiSafepay account.

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay test account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com). 
2. Go to **Settings** > **Website settings**.
3. Click either:  
    {{< details title="Quick add website" >}}

1. From the **Category** dropdown menu, select what type of products or services your website sells.
2. In the **Description** field, enter the website name. This is displayed on the MultiSafepay payment page and, depending on the payment method, on the customer’s bank statement.
3. In the **Base URL** field, add the website’s URL. This must be the URL where you receive payments.
4. In the **Notification URL** field, provide a notification URL for MultiSafepay to send status updates to, if required.

4. If you want to receive [transaction status](/api/multisafepay-statuses/) updates via webhook, in the **Notification URL** field, enter a URL for us to send them to.
5. In the **Description** field, enter the company name you want to appear on payment pages and customer bank statements, and then click **Continue**.  
    A template of your MultiSafepay payment page is generated.

        - **Detail view** to display one detailed box for entering payment details and collapse all other payment methods
        - **API view code** to view the code
    - To replace the MultiSafepay logo in the top-left corner, after completing the wizard, upload your own logo under **Settings** > **Payment page templates**.
    - To hide the MultiSafepay logo in the top-left corner, on the lefthand side under **Settings**, select the **Hide main logo** checkbox.
    - On the lefthand side, under **Header**, **Body**, **Container**, **Cart**, **Payment form**, and **Buttons**, you can change the color of the background, text, lines, and links in different parts of the payment page.
    - To clear your changes and start again, click **Reset style**.

    - Site ID
    - Secure code
    - API key
