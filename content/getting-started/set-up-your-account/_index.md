After successfully creating a test account, it is time to set up your account. With your account, you can generate your [API key](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#api-key), monitor transactions, configure payouts, generate reports, and more. 

Before you can start building your integration, add a website to your account to generate an API key.

To add a website, follow these steps:

1. [Log in](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com) to your account
2. Go to **Settings** > **Website settings**
3. Click **Website wizard** and add your website details

Your test account is now linked to your website. Navigate to the [website settings](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/sites), click your website, and copy the API key to start building your integration.

To learn more about setting up your account, see MultiSafepay Control - [Add website](/tools/multisafepay-control/add-website)
