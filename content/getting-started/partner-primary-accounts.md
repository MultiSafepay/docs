# 2. Onboard affiliate accounts

# 4. Charge affiliates

You can charge fees to affiliates at three levels.

| Account level             | Charge                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Partner/primary level** | Set fixed or percentage-based transaction fees for **all** affiliated merchant accounts.                                                                                                  |
| **Affiliate level**       | Set fixed or percentage-based transaction fees for a specific affiliated merchant account. <br /> This overrides the partner/primary-level settings.                                      |
| **Transaction level**     | [Split incoming payments](/docs/split-payments/) between multiple merchant and/or partner accounts. <br /> You can use this feature for both partner/primary and affiliate-level charges. |
