A payout is when you transfer funds from your account balance to your business bank account.

You can make payouts any time for 0,50 EUR each.

# Business bank accounts
As part of your onboarding, specify a business bank account to pay out to.

The standard currency for automatic payouts is euros (EUR). For manual payouts, you can process other currencies if you specify a business bank account that can receive funds in that currency.

<details id="supported-currencies">
<summary>Supported currencies</summary>
<br>

In addition to EUR, payouts can be made in:

- AUD (Australian dollar)
- CAD (Canadian dollar)
- CHF (Swiss franc)
- CZK (Czech koruna)
- DKK (Danish krone)
- GBP (Pound Sterling)
- JPY (Japanese yen)
- NOK (Norwegian krone)
- PLN (Polish z≈Çoty)
- SEK (Swedish krona)
- USD (United States dollar)

</details>

# Processing times 

The time it takes to process payouts is set by our Risk Team. The default delay before funds arrive in your business bank account for merchants in:

- Belgium and the Netherlands is 1 business day
- Other countries is 3-5 business days

Payout batches are not processed on weekends. That is, payouts initiated on Friday evenings are processed on Monday mornings.

Not all banks support instant payments and therefore may take extra time to process payouts. 

### Bank holidays

MultiSafepay pays out every business day of the year, but **not** on bank holidays. Delayed payouts are made the next business day. 

Check the dates of local bank holidays. They may change each year.

### Automatic payouts

Assuming default settings, if you schedule a payout on Monday, the payout batch includes all captured payments received up to 23:59 on Sunday night. MultiSafepay then processes this batch and initiates the transfer to your business bank account.

The timing for when you receive these funds will vary depending on the default payout delay set for your account. For more information on your payout schedule, please contact your account manager.

### Manual payouts

The status of the pay out is **Reserved** for 24 hours before it is added to our bank‚Äôs payout batch in the morning. Then, the payout is transferred to your business bank account. Manual payouts usually take longer to process than automatic ones.

# Exclusions

You cannot make payouts if:

- Your MultiSafepay account is not yet fully activated.

    <details id="how-to-resolve-account">
    <summary>How to resolve</summary>
    <br>

    You can process payments immediately after creating a MultiSafepay test account and adding your website. But MultiSafepay holds your funds in your account balance until your account is fully activated.

    To check if your account is fully activated, follow these steps:

    1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
       If your account is not fully activated, on the dashboard home page, under **Alerts**, a message appears that your account is incomplete. 
    2. Click **Go to activation**.

    We check and approve your account details and the information on your website. Once approved, we will send you an email that your account is fully activated. 

    </details>

- Your account balance is negative.
    
    <details id="how-to-resolve-balance">
    <summary>How to resolve</summary>
    <br>

    If your account balance is negative (e.g. due to refunds, chargebacks, or fees), payouts are paused until enough funds are available. 

    Always set a "reserved balance" in your payout settings to prevent payout and/or refund delays.
    </details>

- Your payouts are deactivated.
