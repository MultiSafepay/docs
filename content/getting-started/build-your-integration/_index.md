With an API key, you can start building and testing your integration. We offer multiple integration methods. Make sure you choose a method that matches your business needs and tech stack. Our integration methods can roughly be divided into two categories.  

### Ready-made solutions
These solutions are made by our in-house developers. They include plugins, apps and core integrations for many leading ecommerce platforms like Magento, WooCommerce, Shopify, and Lightspeed. These solutions require fewer development resources and allow you to start testing your integration today.

### Custom-built integrations
Build your own integration using our API, SDK's or wrappers. Generally, this requires more development resources. However, these methods provide full control over your checkout experience's look, feel, and functionality. Use these integration methods when you build your own ecommerce website or app.
