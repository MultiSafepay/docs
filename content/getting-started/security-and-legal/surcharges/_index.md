{{< blue-notice >}} Check this page regularly for updates on implementing the PSD2 directive. {{< /blue-notice >}}   

A surcharge is a fee merchants charge customers on top of the retail price to cover the cost of accepting certain payment methods. Surcharges may be a fixed amount or a percentage of the total order amount.

Your right to apply surcharges varies by payment method and the customerâ€™s country. 

{{< alert-notice >}} **Attention Dutch merchants** <br> Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/about-payments/surcharges/) to pay later methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). <br> We therefore strongly recommend **not** applying surcharges. <br> For more information, email <sales@multisafepay.com> {{< /alert-notice >}}

## PSD2

The PSD2 applies to the whole European Economic Area, but individual states can decide how to implement certain aspects. Always check what rules apply in the country your business is registered in. 

In the Netherlands, the [Authority for Consumers & Markets (ACM)](https://www.acm.nl) is responsible for PSD2 oversight. The Dutch National Bank recommends always contacting ACM for inquiries. 

The rules for surcharging customers outside the EU remain unchanged. The PSD2 aims to protect European customers.

## Surcharges prohibited

Surcharges are banned for:

- Most credit card transactions when the bank/card issuer and the merchant's PSP are both located within the European Economic Area (EEA)
- Debit card transactions (for individuals and business customers)
- Standard bank transfers (for individuals and business customers)
- SEPA Direct Debit payments (for individuals and business customers)

{{< alert-notice >}} If you are currently surcharging prohibited transactions, you may need to update your settings in your backend. For support, contact your ecommerce platform or your web developer. {{< /alert-notice >}}

You do **not** need to change any settings in your MultiSafepay dashboard.

## Surcharges permitted

Surcharges are permitted for:

- PayPal and pay later methods: You can only charge customers for the actual cost you incur for using the payment method and no more.

- Card payments with cards issued outside the EEA, e.g. a tourist with a credit card issued in India

For hybrid card schemes such as American Express, each EU country can decide whether to permit surcharging. Surcharging **is** permitted under Dutch law.
