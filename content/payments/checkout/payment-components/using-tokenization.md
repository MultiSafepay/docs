Tokenization lets you store a customer's payment details as a secure, encrypted token to make subsequent payments faster and easier. 

Benefits:

- Improve checkout experience and increase conversion:
    - Customers don't need to re-provide payment details â€“ they autofill at checkout.
    - Subsequent payments are exempt from [SCA requirements](/payment-regulations/sca/) and can skip two-factor authentication.
- Reduce cost and risk by shift responsibility for storing payment details and [PCI DSS compliance](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) to MultiSafepay
