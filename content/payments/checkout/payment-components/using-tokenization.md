Tokenization lets you store a customer's payment details as a secure, encrypted token to make subsequent payments faster and easier. 

Improve checkout experience and increase conversion:

- Customers don't need to re-provide payment details, which autofill at checkout.
- Subsequent payments are exempt from [SCA requirements](/payment-regulations/sca/) and can skip two-factor authentication.


## Creating tokenziation orders

{{< details title="New customers">}}

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Returning customers">}}

{{< /details >}}

To create a tokenization order, see API reference â€“ [Payment Component order](/api/#payment-component-order).
