## Step 3: Create an order

### Collect payment data

**1.** To collect the customer's payment details from the Payment Component UI, call the `PaymentComponent.getPaymentData()` method:

```
PaymentComponent.getPaymentData()
```

**2.** Pass the `payment_data` to your server.

### Create an order

Create an order from your server, appending the `payment_data` collected from the Payment Component UI to the order data.

See API reference â€“ [Payment Component order](/api/#payment-component-order).

### Redirect the customer

**1.** From your server, pass the response to the `POST /orders` request to the customer's device. 

**2.** Check that `response.success` is `true`.

**3.** Handle the response:

{{< details title="Bank transfer payments" >}}

In the `gateway_info` object, you receive the bank account details for the customer to wire the funds to.

Then render the account details in the interface for the customer with clear instructions. (MultiSafepay also emails these details to the customer.)

**Example gateway_info object**
```
{
  "gateway_info":{
    "mtpinfo":"NL25DEUT7351811717",
    "reference":"9202124254788300",
    "issuer_name":"Sofortbank",
    "destination_account_id":"003001380000",
    "destination_holder_name":"MultiSafepay",
    "destination_holder_city":"Zurich",
    "destination_holder_country":"CH",
    "destination_holder_iban":"NL25DEUT7351811717",
    "destination_holder_swift":"DEUTCHZZ",
    "account_holder_name":"testperson-nl approved",
    "account_holder_city":"gravenhage",
    "account_holder_coutry":"NL"
  }
}
```
{{< /details >}}
{{< details title="Other payment methods" >}}
Call the `PaymentComponent.init()` method using the following arguments:
```
PaymentComponent.init('redirection', {
    order: response.data
});
```

If 3D Secure verification is:

- Required, the customer is first directed to 3D Secure. If successful, the customer is then redirected to the `redirect_url`. 
- Not required, the customer is redirected to the `redirect_url`.

{{< /details >}}
