## Collect payment data
**1.** To collect the customer's payment details from the Payment Component UI, call the `PaymentComponent.getPaymentData()` method:

```
PaymentComponent.getPaymentData()
```

**2.** Pass the `payment_data` to your server.

## Create an order

Make a `POST /orders` request from your server, appending the `payment_data` collected from the Payment Component UI to the `orderData` collected during the checkout process.

See API reference â€“ [Payment Component order](/api/#payment-component-order).

## Redirect the customer

**1.** From your server, pass the response to the `POST /orders` request to the customer's device. 

**2.** Check that `response.success` is `true`.

**3.** Call the `PaymentComponent.init()` method using the following arguments:
```
PaymentComponent.init('redirection', {
    order: response.data
});
```
If the customer needs to perform additional actions, they are redirected to the relevant page, e.g. the `payment_url` or 3D Secure. Then, if successful, they are redirected to the `redirect_url`.

If no further action is required, the customer is redirected to the `redirect_url`.
