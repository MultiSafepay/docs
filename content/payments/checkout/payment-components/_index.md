Payment Components are building blocks for embedding payment methods directly into your checkout page that:

- Provide a seamless checkout experience to increase conversion.
- Encrypt customer payment details for secure processing.
- Shift responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) to MultiSafepay.

## Integration

Embed a payment method of choice in your checkout. The customer completes the payment within your checkout or is redirected to the relevant payment page.

## Customization

You can customize the look of the payment component to match your brand's visual identity, and set the display language.

For instructions, see [Customizing payment components](/payments/checkout/payment-components/customizing-payment-components/).
