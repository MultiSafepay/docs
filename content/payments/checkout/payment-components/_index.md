Payment Components let you embed payment methods directly into your checkout.

- Creates a seamless checkout experience to increase [conversion](/getting-started/glossary/#conversion-rate)
- Encrypts customer payment details for secure processing
- Shifts responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) to MultiSafepay

## Integration

Embed a selected payment method in your checkout. The customer completes payment within your checkout or is redirected to the relevant payment page.
