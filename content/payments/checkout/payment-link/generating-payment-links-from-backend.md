For some ecommerce integrations, you can generate payment links in your [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend). 

For example, for Magento 1 or a custom integration, you can make a create an order request to our API. 

See API Reference - [Create an order](https://docs.multisafepay.com/api/#create-an-order). In parameter `type`,  enter `'payment link'`. 

For support, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

For more information about creating payment links using our API, see API Reference - [Generating a payment link](/api/#generating-a-payment-link).
