Payment links create a unique transaction in your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) to match to a payment.

## Simple mode and advanced mode

Simple mode is the default payment link mode, which contains the minimum necessary information. 

In advanced mode, you can enter the order items and add extra information about the customer, e.g. birthday, full address, phone number.
