FastCheckout is MultiSafepay's own one-click checkout solution, for a fast, frictionless customer experience and increased conversion.

It consists of modular checkout steps to create a tailored experience for each customer, and  is optimized for mobile and desktop. You can also follow up abandoned checkouts with [Second Chance](/features/second-chance/).

## How it works

1. First-time customers can use FastCheckout as a guest and then create a FastCheckout account (once only). We store their billing and shipping information to accelerate checkout the next time they shop. 
You have access to the accounts of all customers across the FastCheckout network.

2. When the customer returns, they simply click the **FastCheckout** button on the shopping cart page. No password required!

3. The customer is redirected to the hosted FastCheckout page.
