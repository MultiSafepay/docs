FastCheckout is MultiSafepay's own one-click checkout solution for a fast, frictionless customer experience and increased conversion.

FastCheckout is highly flexible and fully customizable. It consists of modular checkout steps (billing, shipping, and payment) to create a tailored experience for each customer. You can also follow up abandoned checkouts with [Second Chance](/features/second-chance/).

New features and payment methods are made available automatically. No updates or upgrades required. FastCheckout is optimized for both mobile and desktop.

## How it works

First-time customers can use FastCheckout as a guest and then create a FastCheckout account (once only). We store their billing and shipping information to accelerate checkout the next time they shop. You have access to the accounts of all customers across the entire FastCheckout network.

When the customer returns, they simply click the **FastCheckout** button on the shopping cart page. No password required!
