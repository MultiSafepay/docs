If a customer's country is unclear or your backend doesn't let you provide the correct country code, consider displaying all your enabled payment methods on the payment page. This is only supported for [PayV2 payment pages](/payments/checkout/payment-pages/activating-payv2/).

To display all payment methods on the payment page, follow these steps:

1. [Create an order](/api/#create-an-order) to retrieve the payment link.
2. Put `&methods=all` behind the payment link, e.g.:

``` https://testpayv2.multisafepay.com/connect/822LtiM8RjN313Yo5C46E2cjqmuL5qVfc7w/?lang=en_NL ```

3. Redirect the customer to the adapted link.

**Note:** This is not a standard option in our [ecommerce integrations](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations).
