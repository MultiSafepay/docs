Merchants with a custom integration built using our [API](/api) can use dynamic styling to change the look and feel of V2 payment page templates for every transaction.

For more information about V2 payment pages, see [Classic payment page](/checkout/payment-pages/classic-payment-page).

There are two ways of dynamically styling payment page templates:

## Saved templates
If you have stored a template, you can request it in the first-level JSON object `"template_id": "value of the template"`.

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to the WYSIWYG editor, and use it to style the template.
3. Save the template with a unique name, e.g. Template 1. This is used as the `template_id`.
4. Add the `template_id` to your `POST /orders` request for **every** transaction.

## Template object 
You can also style templates in real time. See API Reference â€“ [Apply dynamic templates](https://docs.multisafepay.com/api/#dynamic-styling).

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to the WYSIWYG editor, and use it to style the template.
3. Go to **</> API view code** to retrieve the code.
4. Add the code to your `POST /orders` request for **every** transaction.
