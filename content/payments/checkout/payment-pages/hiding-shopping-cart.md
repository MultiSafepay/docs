**2.** Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/). 

**3.** Go to **Settings** > **New payment pages**.

**4.** Next to the relevant website, click **Template**.

**5.** Under **Configure page style**, click **Settings**, and then select the **Hide cart details** checkbox.
