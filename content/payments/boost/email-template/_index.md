To speed up and customize customer emails, you can use preformatted and/or prewritten templates that you populate with relevant content.

**Step 1.** Set an email template.

- Sign in to your MultiSafepay account. 
- Go to **Settings** > **Email templates**.  
- Click the relevant website.  
- Click **Add new template**.   

**Step 2.** From the **Type** dropdown menu, select the template type.  

{{< details title="Template types" >}}

**Bank transfer details email (to customer)**  
For sending customers MultiSafepay's bank details when they select [Bank Transfer](/payments/methods/banks/bank-transfer) as payment method and you send a [`redirect`](/developer/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect/) transaction request. 

**Chargeback email (to merchant)**  
For notifying you when a customer requests a [chargeback](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/chargebacks/) (recommended if you accept credit card payments).

Make sure you add one or more email addresses to send these emails to in your MultiSafepay account, under 
**Contact information** > **Chargeback email**. 

**Manual capture reservation completed (to customer)**

For confirming that you have manually captured reserved funds for an [Uncleared transaction](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/evaluating-uncleared-transactions/).  

**Partial and/or full capture completed (to customer)**  
For notifying customers that you have partially or fully captured reserved funds for an [Uncleared transaction](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/evaluating-uncleared-transactions/). 

**Partial and/or full capture completed (to merchant)**  
For confirming that you have partially or fully captured reserved funds for an [Uncleared transaction](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/evaluating-uncleared-transactions/).

**Step 3.** To set the email language either select one from the **Language** dropdown menu, or set the locale. 

{{< details title="Setting the locale" >}}

A locale is a set of parameters that defines the userâ€™s language and region for:

- Payment pages
- Emails sent by MultiSafepay

Use the format ab_CD with [ISO 639](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) language codes and [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) country codes, e.g. 'nl_NL' or 'en_US'.

When no locale is provided or the language is not supported by MultiSafepay, American English is used by default. 

For example, if an email template is set for a German customer, but the locale is received as en_US, the email template will be sent in English and not in German.

- In the **From name** field, enter the name you want the email sent by.
- In the **Subject** field, enter a subject.

**Step 5.** You can edit the text in the **Body plain** field, or if you know HTML and CSS, you can fully customize the content and layout in the **Body HTML** field.
