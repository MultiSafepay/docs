### 1. Requirements
- To use the plugin you need a MultiSafepay account. You can [create a test account here](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup).
- Install the [MultiSafepay Magento 2 GraphQL plugin](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2-graphql) to add support for GraphQL queries.
- Meet the [Magento's requirements](https://magento.github.io/pwa-studio/venia-pwa-concept/setup/#prerequisites) for PWA Studio (Venia) on Magento.

### 2. Supported payment methods
This extension supports all [payment methods supported by our Magento 2 plugin](https://docs.multisafepay.com/payments/integrations/ecommerce-platforms/magento2/faq/available-payment-methods-magento2/) out of the box, except: 
- Request To Pay
- Direct Debit
- E-invoicing 
- Pay After Delivery  
However, you can easily integrate these payment methods yourself. For reference, you can take a look at our [PWA Studio components](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/pwastudio-multisafepay-payment-integration/tree/master/src/components) on GitHub.

### 3. Installation and configuration (GitHub)

If you want to install the MultiSafepay plugin into your PWA Studio application, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/pwastudio-multisafepay-payment-integration#installation-guide) on our GitHub page.

We are also available on the [Magento's MultiSafepay Slack channel](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/messages/multisafepay-payments/).
