**About Shopware 6**  
Shopware 6 is the latest version of the Shopware ecommerce platform. It maintains simplicity, but features a great new interface and functionalities, including:

* Sales Channels function that links to social shopping platforms (e.g. Facebook, Instagram), and supports mobile apps and [POS](/getting-started/glossary/#point-of-sale-pos-terminal) systems
* Rule Builder that lets you set price rules per country, and supports multi-currency options, VAT rules, and delivery options, e.g. free delivery for orders above a specified amount
* Content management function that uses stylized blocks on Experience and Storytelling pages
* Text editor that is easier and more user-friendly
