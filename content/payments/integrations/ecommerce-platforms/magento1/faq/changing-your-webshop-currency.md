MultiSafepay processes payments in Euros (EUR) as the default [currency](/faq/general/which-currencies-are-supported-by-multisafepay). Our Magento 1 plugin follows the same default.

To change to a different currency for your webshop, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Magento 1 [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend). 
2. Go to **System** > **Configuration** > **MultiSafepay x.x.x** > **Connect settings**.
3. Under **Allow currency conversion to Euro**, change to **No**.
