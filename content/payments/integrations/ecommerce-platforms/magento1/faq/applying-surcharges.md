1. Sign in to your Magento 1 backend.
2. Select systems and configuration.
3. In the MultiSafepay module, select the **Option connect** gateway.
4. Select the relevant payment method.
5. Under **Payment fee amount**, enter a surcharge percentage or fixed amount. 
6. Place a test order to verify whether the fee has been correctly processed.
