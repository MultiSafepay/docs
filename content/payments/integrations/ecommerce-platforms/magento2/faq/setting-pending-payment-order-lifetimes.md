The lifetime of orders marked as **Pending payments** in Magento 2 is determined by the **Order Cron settings** configuration. The default value is 480 minutes (8 hours).

For payment methods with a validation period longer than 8 hours, the status of orders in Magento 2 automatically changes to **Canceled** due to the default value. To fix this, increase the **Order Cron settings** value to longer than the validation period. 

**Setting pending payment order lifetimes**

To set the lifetime of pending payments orders, see Magento - [Pending payment order lifetime](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/sales/order-pending-payment-lifetime.html).

**ERP systems**

For ERP systems, if the order status is **Declined**, successful payments often fail to process for orders with **Canceled** status.

The lifetime of [bank transfers](/payments/methods/banks/bank-transfer/#how-does-it-work) is 86400 minutes (60 days).

The order status changes to **Cancelled** in Magento 2 before the payment can be linked.
