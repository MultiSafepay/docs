The MultiSafepay Magento 2 plugin supports [Payment Components](/payments/checkout/payment-components/), which:

- Provide a seamless checkout experience to increase [conversion](/getting-started/glossary/#conversion-rate).
- Encrypt customer payment details for secure processing.
- Shift responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) to MultiSafepay.

If you're new to accepting credit card payments, email applications to activate them your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

**Activating the Payment Component**

To activate the Payment Component in your Magento 2 [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend), follow these steps:

2. Go to **Configuration** > **Credit card**, and then click **Configure**.
3. Click **Payment type** and select **Credit card component**.
4. Click **Save config**.

For questions, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

**Note:** If you have a custom checkout and encounter a conflict with the Payment Component, the Integration Team will do their best to provide support, but we can't guarantee compatibility in all cases.
