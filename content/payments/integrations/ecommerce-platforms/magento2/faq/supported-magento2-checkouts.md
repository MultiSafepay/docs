MultiSafepay supports multiple checkouts:

{{< details title="Magento 2 core checkout" >}}
Our plugin works out of the box with the Magento 2 core checkout which is based on the Luma theme.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="OneStepCheckout.com" >}}
MultiSafepay is an official partner of [OneStepCheckout.com](https://www.onestepcheckout.com/).

Our plugin works with the latest version of the OneStepCheckout extension. If you have questions or notice missing features or bugs when both plugins are installed, feel free to contact our integration team at [integration@multisafepay.com](mailto:integration@multisafepay.com)
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Other checkouts" >}}
Our plugin has been tested with the following checkouts:

- [MagePlaza One Step Checkout](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-one-step-checkout-extension)
- [Amasty One Step Checkout](https://amasty.com/one-step-checkout-for-magento-2.html)

Most Magento checkout plugins are compatible with our plugin, but we cannot guarantee that all features will function properly.
