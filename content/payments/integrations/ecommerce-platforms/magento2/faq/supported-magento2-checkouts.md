We test our plugin at two Magento 2 checkouts:  

- Magento 2 core checkout  
- [MagePlaza OneStepCheckout](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-one-step-checkout-extension)

Most Magento checkout plugins are compatible with our plugin, but we cannot guarantee that all features will function properly.
