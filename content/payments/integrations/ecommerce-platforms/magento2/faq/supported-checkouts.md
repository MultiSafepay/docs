MultiSafepay supports multiple checkouts:

**Magento 2 core checkout**  
Our plugin works out of the box with the Magento 2 core checkout, which is based on the Luma theme.

**OneStepCheckout.com**  
MultiSafepay is an official partner of [OneStepCheckout.com](https://www.onestepcheckout.com/). Our plugin works with the latest version of the OneStepCheckout extension. 

**Hyvä**  
Our plugin is compatible with Hyvä's [themes](https://hyva.io/hyva-themes-license.html) and [checkout](https://hyva.io/hyva-checkout.html). 

**Other checkouts**  
We have tested our plugin with the following checkouts:

- [MagePlaza One Step Checkout](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-one-step-checkout-extension)
- [Amasty One Step Checkout](https://amasty.com/one-step-checkout-for-magento-2.html)

Most Magento checkout plugins are compatible with our plugin, but we cannot guarantee that all features will function properly.
