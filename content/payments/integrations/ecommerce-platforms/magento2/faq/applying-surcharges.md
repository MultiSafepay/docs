Applying [surcharges](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-surcharges/) or payment fees is no longer supported in the Magento 2 plugin.

**Using Fooman**
To apply a surcharge or payment fee to a payment method, you can use the third-party [Fooman](https://store.fooman.co.nz/extensions/magento2) package.

You can refund orders with a Fooman surcharge applied in your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), but not from your Magento 2 [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend). 

**Support**
The Integration Team will do their best to support you with installing Fooman, but bear in mind that it is a third-party package. We can't guarantee perfect compatibility.

**PSD2 implications**
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-payment-service-directive-2).
