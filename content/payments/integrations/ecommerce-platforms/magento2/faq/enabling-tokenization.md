To enable tokenization:

1. Sign in to your Magento 2 [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **MultiSafepay** > **MultiSafepay settings**.

For more information, see [Tokenization](/payments/features/tokenization/).

**Credit cards**

Tokenization is not available for the generic credit card gateway. You must enable the Visa, Mastercard, and/or Maestro gateways separately. This displays the **Save card** option at checkout.
