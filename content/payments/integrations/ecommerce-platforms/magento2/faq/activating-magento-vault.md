The MultiSafepay Magento 2 plugin supports Magento Vault, which is essentially a way of processing [recurring payments](/features/recurring-payments/) using the Magento payment gateway.

Magento Vault:

- Stores payment methods as a token in the Magento database
- Minimizes purchase time for returning customers
- Facilitates a fast, secure checkout process
- Increases [conversion](/getting-started/glossary/#conversion-rate)

For more information, see Magento 2 â€“ [Adding vault integration](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/payments-integrations/vault/vault-intro.html).

**Activating Magento Vault**
To activate Magento Vault in your Magento back end, you must first enable [recurring payments](/features/recurring-payments/) in your MultiSafepay account. 

For any questions about integrating Magento Vault, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
