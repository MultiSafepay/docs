Our plugin supports Magento Vault, which lets customers securely store their payment details as a token in the Magento database. This makes subsequent payments faster and easier, increasing conversion. At checkout, customers can simply select the **Instant purchase** button and don't have to re-provide their CVC. Magento Vault uses [card-on-file tokenziation](/features/recurring-payments/).

Magento Vault:


For more information, see Magento 2 â€“ [Adding vault integration](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/payments-integrations/vault/vault-intro.html).

**Requirements from Mastercard and Visa**  

You must:  

- Ask customers when entering their card details to check a checkbox to give permission to store the payment details for future purchases.
- Add information to your terms and conditions about how you will use and store this data.
- Inform customers how they can delete saved payment details.

**Activating Magento Vault**  

To activate Magento Vault in your backend, you must first enable [recurring payments](/features/recurring-payments/) in your MultiSafepay account.
