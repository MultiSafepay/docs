The MultiSafepay Magento 2 plugin supports Magento Vault, which is essentially a means of [tokenization](/payments/features/tokenization/) using the Magento payment gateway.

Magento Vault:

- Stores payment methods as a token in the Magento database
- Minimizes purchase time for returning customers
- Facilitates a fast, secure checkout process
- Increases [conversion](/getting-started/glossary/#conversion-rate)

## Activating Magento Vault
To activate Magento Vault in your Magento back end, you must first enable [recurring payments](/payments/features/recurring-payments/) in your MultiSafepay account. 

For more information, see:

- [How to activate Recurring Payments](/payments/features/recurring-payments/activating-recurring-payments/) 
- [Requirements](/payments/features/recurring-payments/about-recurring-payments/#requirements)
