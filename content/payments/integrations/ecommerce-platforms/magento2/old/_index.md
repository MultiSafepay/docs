{{< alert-notice >}} **Alert!** This plugin is end-of-life and we are phasing out support. Migrate to the [new plugin](/payments/integrations/ecommerce-platforms/magento2/) as soon as possible. {{< /alert-notice >}}

### Introduction

The installation can be carried out in three ways:

+ SFTP
+ Composer
+ Magento Marketplace.

In this manual we describe the installation via Composer.
