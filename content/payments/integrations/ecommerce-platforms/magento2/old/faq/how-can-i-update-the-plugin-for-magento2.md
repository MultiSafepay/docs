Generally, there are three ways to update a plugin. This can be done through the backend and through the marketplace from a CMS or through SFTP. However, for Magento 2 we will be describing the necessary steps via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

Before you update the plugin, we strongly recommend you the following:

* Make sure you have a backup of your production environment
* Test the plugin in a staging environment.

Go to our [Manual](/payments/integrations/ecommerce-platforms/magento2/#manual) page, download the plugin and follow the instructions from step 2.
