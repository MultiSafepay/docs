Our plugin is compatible with most Magento 2 checkouts. However, we cannot guarantee that all checkouot features will function properly.

We test our plugin with two Magento 2 checkouts:  

- Magento 2 core checkout  
- [MagePlaza OneStepCheckout](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-one-step-checkout-extension)

{{< blue-notice>}}**Note:** Always test OneStepCheckout before use to make sure it is compatible with your specific configuration of the plugin. {{< /blue-notice>}}
