Applying [surcharges](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-surcharges/) or payment fees is no longer supported in the Woocommerce plugin.

**Using third party packages**
To apply a surcharge or payment fee to a payment method, you can use third-party packages that follow the WooCommerce and Wordpress development guidelines.

**Support**
The Integration Team will do their best to support you with installing a third-party package, but bear in mind that it is a third-party package. We can't guarantee perfect compatibility.

**PSD2 implications**
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-payment-service-directive-2).
