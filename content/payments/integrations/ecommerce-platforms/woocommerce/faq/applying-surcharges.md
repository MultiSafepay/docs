You can apply [surcharges](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-surcharges/) or payment fees with the WooCommerce plugin when combined with a relevant third-party package. The package must follow WooCommerce and Wordpress development guidelines.

**Support**
The Integration Team will do their best to help you install third-party packages, but we can't guarantee perfect compatibility.

**PSD2 implications**
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-payment-service-directive-2).
