To install or migrate, follow these steps:

1. For increased security and stability, wait for off-peak hours and temporarily enable password protection for your webshop.
2. From the [Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/), install the [MultiSafepay Payments app](https://apps.shopify.com/multisafepay-payments).  
3. Check that the app is successfully added under **Admin** > **Settings** > **Payments** > **Alternative payment methods**.
4. In your Shopify checkout, test the **MultiSafepay Payments** gateway.  
  **Note:** If using a test [API key](/account/site-id-api-key-secure-code/), make sure you also enable **Test mode**. 
5. For existing merchants, you must disable the deprecated individual MultiSafepay payment method gateways under **Admin** > **Settings** > **Payments** > **Third-party payment providers**.
6. Once testing is complete, disable password protection again.
