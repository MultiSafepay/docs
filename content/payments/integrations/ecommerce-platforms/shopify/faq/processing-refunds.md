Refund rules:

- From your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com): Refunds supported
- From your Shopify [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend):  
    - Refunds are supported. See Shopify â€“ [Creating returns and refunds](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/refund-cancel-order).
    - Refunding more than the original transaction is **not** supported.
    - Cancelled orders are not automatically refunded in your backend. You must refund them from your MultiSafepay account. 

**Note:** It can take up to 24 hours for refunds to be fully synchronized between your backend and your MultiSafepay account.
