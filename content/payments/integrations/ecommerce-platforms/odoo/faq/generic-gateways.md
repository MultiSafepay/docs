The Odoo plugin offers a [generic gateway](/developer/general/generic-gateways/). The generic gateway can be found under **Invoicing** > **Payment method** > **Other payment acquirer** > **MultiSafepay**.

All of our payment methods are supported. You can set the gateway code using the title field. The gateway logo and gateway name can also be changed.

Similar to other gateways, it is possible to filter the generic gateway by:

- Countries
- Min amount
- Max amount

Refunds are only possible with fully completed orders.
