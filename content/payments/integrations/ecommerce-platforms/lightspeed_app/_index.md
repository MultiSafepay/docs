This technical manual is for installing and configuring our free app for integrating MultiSafepay payment solutions into your Lightspeed webshop.  

For our deprecated Lightspeed core integration, see [Lightspeed core](/ecommerce-platforms/lightspeed-core/).

{{< details title="Test environment" >}}
&nbsp;  
We recommend first installing the app in a test environment following the recommended Lightspeed installation procedure. Make sure you have made a backup.

This app is tested using the default one-step and one-page checkout using the default theme.

{{< details title="JavaScript" >}}

For the best user experience, we provide some Javascript and images, e.g. to add a drop-down for iDEAL and MultiSafepay icons for other payment methods. 

Some user-added themes or scripts may cause issues, e.g. missing images for payment methods. 

For assistance, ask your developer. 

All payment methods still work if you don't use the Javascript files.
