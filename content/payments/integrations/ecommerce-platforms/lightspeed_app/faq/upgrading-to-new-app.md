To upgrade from the classic [MultiSafepay Lightspeed core integration](/payments/integrations/ecommerce-platforms/lightspeed_core) to the Lightspeed app, follow these steps:

1. In the [Lightspeed app manual](/lightspeed/#installation), follow the steps to install the Lightspeed app.

2. Place a test order to make sure it is working properly.

3. Open the [classic MultiSafepay payment gateway settings](https://services.webshopapp.com/login/?redirect=/payment_providers/859452), and then disable the payment provider.

To switch back to the classic core integration, uninstall the app from the app store and re-enable the classic integration.
