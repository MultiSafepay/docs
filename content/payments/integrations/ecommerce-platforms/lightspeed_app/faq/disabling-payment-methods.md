### Disabling payment methods
You can disable payment methods in the **Payment methods ordering list**. Disabled payment methods appear with a strikethrough.

To disable payment methods for specific languages, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Lightspeed app.
2. Under **Payment methods ordering**, select the relevant country.
3. For each language, disable the relevant payment methods. 

If no specific language rule-set, **Default** is used.

### Missing payment methods

By default, newly activated payment methods in your MultiSafepay account are disabled in the Lightspeed app's MultiSafepay payments settings. You need to enable them in both environments.

If a payment method is missing:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/multisafepay-control) and check that the payment method is enabled.
2. Sign in to your Lightspeed app, go to **Settings**, and then enable the payment method again.
