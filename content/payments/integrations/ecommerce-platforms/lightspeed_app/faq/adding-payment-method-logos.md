Payment method logos may be missing due to a theme that is causing them to not appear on your Lightspeed website. 

To add missing payment method logogs, follow these steps:

1. Download the logos from our [Github repo](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/MultiSafepay-icons).
2. Rename the file with upper case formatting, e.g applepay.png > APPLEPAY.png.
3. Sign in to your Lightspeed app.
4. Go to **Design** > **Theme editor** > **Advanced** > **Edit code** > **Assets**, and drop in the logos.  

The logos won't appear instantly. It takes a little time.
