When changing internationalization in your Lightspeed eCom backend, make sure the primary language remains active/inactive while installing the app.  Lightspeed eCom requires a language, an API key, and cluster to validate API requests. If you remove the language used during installation instead of deactivating it, the app cannot communicate with Lightspeed eCom services.
