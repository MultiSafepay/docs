When changing internationalization within the Lightspeed eCom backend make sure the primary language during the installation of the app stays active or deactive.  Lightspeed eCom requires a language in combination with an api key and cluster as validation to make api calls. When the language used during the installation is removed instead of deactivated the app is unable to communicate with the Lightspeed eCom services.
