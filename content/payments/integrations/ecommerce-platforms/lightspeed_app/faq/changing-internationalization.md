When changing internationalization in your Lightspeed eCom backend, do **not** change the primary language setting while installing the app.  

Lightspeed eCom requires a language, an API key, and a cluster to validate API requests. 

If you remove the language used during installation instead of deactivating it, the app cannot communicate with Lightspeed eCom services.
