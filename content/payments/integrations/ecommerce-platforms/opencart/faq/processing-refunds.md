**Refund rules**  

- From your [MultiSafepay account](/account/multisafepay-account/processing-refunds/): Full refunds 
- From your OpenCart [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend):  
    - Full refunds
    - Refunding more than the original transaction is **not** supported

To process refunds from your backend, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your OpenCart backend.
2. Go to **Orders** > **Order view button** > **Order history panel**. 
3. Click the **Refund** button. This only appears if the order status is **Completed** or **Shipped**.
