To generate a payment link for orders created in your OpenCart [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend), follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your OpenCart backend.
2. Go to **System** > **Localisation** > **Order status**.
3. Enter a custom order status for when the payment link is sent.
4. Go to **Extensions** > **Payments** > **MultiSafepay**.
5. Set the **Generate payment links at the admin** field to **Yes**.
6. On the **Options** tab > **Payment request** field, set the **Previously created order status**.
7. To reserve stock units of order items generated by the admin, while the order status is still **Pending**, go to **System** > **Settings** > **Store** > **Options** tab. 
8. In the **Processing order status** field, set the order status previously registered as **Payment request**.
9. Go to **Sales** > **Orders** > **Add new order**.
10. Enter all the order details in the following tabs:  
    - **Customer details**  
    - **Products**  
    - **Payment details**  
    - **Shipping details** 
11. At the fifth step **Totals**, in the **Payment method** field, select a MultiSafepay payment method.
12. In the **Order status** field, select the order status previously registered as **Payment request**.
13. To process the order, click **Save**.

The customer receives the payment link in the email sent by OpenCart containing the order details. The payment link is also added to the order history details.
