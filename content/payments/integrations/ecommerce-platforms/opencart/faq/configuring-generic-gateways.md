The OpenCart plugin supports [generic gateways](/faq/general/generic-gateways/) for all payment methods.  

To configure generic gateways, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your OpenCart [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Plugin settings** > **Payment methods** tab.
3. Set the:  
    - Gateway code  
    - Gateway logo  
    - Gateway label  
    - Whether to include the shopping cart in refunds. Required for billing suite gateway codes.

You can also set a custom initial order status.

You can filter generic gateways by:

- Geographic zone
- Currency
- Minimum amount
- Maximum amount
- Customer groups

Full refunds, partial refunds (except for billing suite payment methods), and backend orders are fully supported.
