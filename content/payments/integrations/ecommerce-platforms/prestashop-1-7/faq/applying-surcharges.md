Applying [surcharges](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-surcharges/) or payment fees is not automatically supported in our PrestaShop 1.7 plugin.

**Support**  
The Integration Team will do their best to support you, but bear in mind that it is a third-party package. We can't guarantee perfect compatibility.

**PSD2 implications**  
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-payment-service-directive-2).
