The PrestaShop 1.7 plugin supports a [generic gateway](/faq/general/generic-gateways/) for all payment methods. 

To configure the generic gateway, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your PrestaShop [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **IMPROVE** > **MultiSafepay** -> **Payment methods**. All payment methods are listed here.
3. Select **Generic gateway** and set:
   * Gateway code
   * Gateway icon

- You can filter the generic gateway by:
  - Country
  - Currency
  - Customer group
  - Minimum amount
  - Maximum amount
