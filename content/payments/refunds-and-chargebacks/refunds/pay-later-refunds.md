## API

Pay later refunds require a `shopping_cart` object in the refund request. 

See API reference â€“ [Refund with shopping cart](/api/#refund-with-shopping-cart).

## Multiple order rules

If you supply multiple order rules with the same `merchant-item-id` and the customer requests a partial refund, this creates a conflict. 

To successfully process partial refunds for the same product with different specifications (e.g. size, color) via the shopping cart, each `merchant-item-id` must be unique.

**Example:** For different-sized products, differentiate the `merchant-item-id` with `-size`: 1001311-xxl, 1001311-m, 1001311-s.
