To help you optimize conversion and manage risk, MultiSafepay supports several exemptions from [3D Secure 2.0](/features/3d-secure/about/) (3DS2) and [strong customer authentication](/payment-regulations/psd2/) (SCA).

Under the [PSD2](/payment-regulations/psd2/), some exemptions are only supported **outside** of Europe.

{{< alert-notice >}} **Important:** Exemptions remove an important layer of security and increase the risk of fraud. You bear the risk and become liable for any [fraud-related chargebacks](/chargebacks/). {{< /alert-notice>}}

## Transaction risk analysis

MultiSafepay can conduct a transaction risk analysis (TRA) for specific transactions for amounts up to EUR&nbsp;500. The issuer may soft decline the exemption, in which case the customer is automatically redirected to authenticate.
