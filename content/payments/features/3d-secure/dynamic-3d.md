[3D Secure](/features/3d-secure/about/) authentication is enabled by default for all credit card payments. 

Dynamic 3D Secure lets you set rules to disable 3D Secure for specific credit card payments, e.g. based on:

- Transaction amount
- Card/customer/IP country

The most common reason for disabling 3D Secure is if you have a lot of customers outside Europe who don't have access to it. Consider setting a rule for transactions with a non-European card and a billing address outside of Europe.

{{< alert-notice >}} **Important:** Removing the layer of security provided by 3D Secure increases the risk of fraud. You bear the risk and become liable for any [fraud-related chargebacks](/payments/chargebacks/). {{< /alert-notice>}}
