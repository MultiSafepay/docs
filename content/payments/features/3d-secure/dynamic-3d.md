Dynamic 3D is a MultiSafepay solution that lets you set rules to disable [3D Secure](/features/3d-secure/about/) authentication for specific credit card payments, e.g. based on amount, or card/customer/IP country.

{{< alert-notice >}} **Important:** Removing the layer of security provided by 3D Secure increases the risk of fraud. You bear the risk and become liable for any [fraud-related chargebacks](/chargebacks/). {{< /alert-notice>}}

## Use cases

The most common reasons for disabling 3D Secure are:

**Customer base outside Europe**  
You have a lot of customers outside Europe who don't have access to 3D Secure. Consider setting a rule for transactions with a non-European card and a billing address outside of Europe.

**PSD2 exemptions**  
You want to apply exemptions to [PSD2](/payment-regulations/psd2/) requirements (on request):

- Payments subject to transaction risk analysis (TRA) maximum 250 EUR
- Low value payments (LVP) under 30 EUR

This can help you optimize conversion and minimize risk.

## Pricing
MultiSafepay applies a different fee to non-3D Secure transactions. We may also charge a fee for implementing Dynamic 3D.
