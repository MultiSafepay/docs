Tokenization is substituting sensitive customer payment details with a non-sensitive token to reduce risk. For example, a unique recurring ID is created to replace credit card details, which is encrypted as a unique string of numbers that is automatically issued in real-time. The token is used online in approved environments to complete the payment. 

Customers can then complete payments in one step by selecting the stored token in their account. Customers may have multiple tokens.

Tokenization is mainly used for credit card, recurring, and subscription payments, but is also available for bank payment methods.

## Recurring models
MultiSafepay offers three recurring models:

- **Card on file (COF)**: The cardholder has authorized you to store their card details.
- **Subscription**: An agreement or services that are billed at the end of your billing cycle, e.g. weekly, monthly.
- **Unscheduled**: Event-triggered, e.g. mobile top-up when no credit left on the phone.

Our [SDKs](/developer/wrappers/) support all three models. Our [plugins](/payments/integrations/) use COF only. 

## Via API
To use tokenization via our API, see API Reference â€“ [Tokenization and recurring model](/api/#recurring-payment).

**Note:** Tokens for SEPA Direct Debit "DIRDEB" transactions are originally received as iDEAL or SOFORT Banking transactions.
