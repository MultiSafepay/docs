To speed up and customize customer emails, you can use preformatted and/or prewritten templates that you populate with relevant content.

**Step 1.** Set an email template.

- Sign in to your MultiSafepay account. 
- Go to **Settings** > **Email templates**.  
- Click the relevant website.  
- Click **Add new template**.   

**Step 2.** From the **Type** dropdown menu, select the template type.  

{{< details title="Template types" >}}

**Bank transfer details email (to customer)**  
For sending customers MultiSafepay's bank details when they select [Bank Transfer](/payment-methods/bank-transfer) as payment method and you send a [`redirect`](/developer/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect/) transaction request. 

**Chargeback email (to merchant)**  
For notifying you when a customer requests a [chargeback](/payments/chargebacks/about/) (recommended if you accept credit card payments).

Make sure you add one or more email addresses to send these emails to in your MultiSafepay account, under 
**Contact information** > **Chargeback email**. 

**Manual Capture reservation completed (to customer)**  
For notifying customers that you have manually captured reserved funds for an [Uncleared transaction](/credit-cards-user-guide/uncleared-transactions/). 

**Manual Capture reservation completed (to merchant)**  
For confirming that you have manually captured reserved funds for an [Uncleared transaction](/credit-cards-user-guide/uncleared-transactions/).  

**Partial and/or full capture completed (to customer)**  
For notifying customers that you have partially or fully captured reserved funds for an [Uncleared transaction](/credit-cards-user-guide/uncleared-transactions/). 

**Partial and/or full capture completed (to merchant)**  
For confirming that you have partially or fully captured reserved funds for an [Uncleared transaction](/credit-cards-user-guide/uncleared-transactions/).

**Refund complete email (to customer)**  
For notifying customers that you have processed their refund. 

**Second Chance email (to customer)**  
For sending customers a friendly reminder to complete a payment. 

Make sure you have enabled [Second Chance](/features/second-chance/) in your MultiSafepay account.

**Transaction completed email (to customer)**  
For sending payment confirmation to customers. 

**Transaction completed email (to merchant)**  
For notifying you that a customer has successfully completed a payment.

**Step 3.** To set the email language either select one from the **Language** dropdown menu, or set the locale. 

{{< details title="Setting the locale" >}}

A locale is a set of parameters that defines the userâ€™s language and region for:

- Payment pages
- Emails sent by MultiSafepay

Use the format ab_CD with [ISO 639](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) language codes and [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) country codes, e.g. 'nl_NL' or 'en_US'.

When no locale is provided or the language is not supported by MultiSafepay, American English is used by default. 

For example, if an email template is set for a German customer, but the locale is received as en_US, the email template will be sent in English and not in German.

{{< /details >}}

**Step 4.** You can click **Load default template** or fill in the fields as required.

- In the **From address** field, enter the email address you want the email sent from.
- In the **From name** field, enter the name you want the email sent by.
- In the **Subject** field, enter a subject.

{{< details title="Changing the from address" >}}
&nbsp;  
If you enter a different from address than noreply@multisafepay.com, we recommend adding the following DNS record to your domain to avoid emails being marked as spam:  
`v=spf1 ip4:213.189.0.0/23 ip4:185.99.128.0/22 mx`
{{< /details >}}

**Step 5.** You can edit the text in the **Body plain** field, or if you know HTML and CSS, you can fully customize the content and layout in the **Body HTML** field. 

To view the HTML/CSS code, click **Source**.

{{< details title="Adding links" >}}

1. Click the **Link** icon.
2. Select the link type: URL, anchor link, or mail to link
3. Fill in the additional fields as required.
4. Click **OK**. 

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Using @tokens@" >}}

To save time, you can use @tokens@ to auto-fill personalized details into emails.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to the Body HTML editor on the email template page.
2. Click the **Token** icon.
3. Select a token from the dropdown menu.
4. Click **OK**.

The table below describes all available tokens.
