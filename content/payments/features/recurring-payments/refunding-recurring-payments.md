You can only refund recurring transactions to customers when the [transaction status](/api/multisafepay-statuses/) is **Completed**. 

To refund a transaction, follow these steps:

1. In your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), go to **Transactions** > **Transaction overview**.
2. Search for the transaction and open the **Transaction details** page.
3. Select **Refund**.
5. Enter the amount that you want to refund to the customer.
6. Click **Confirm**.

By default, you cannot refund more than the amount of the original transaction. To check if you are eligible to refund more, email your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

The transaction status is now **Initialized**. As long as the transaction status is **Initialized**, the refund can be cancelled. When the status changes to **Completed**, the refund is processed correctly. 

The customer receives the refund in the bank account from which the transaction was paid within the next business day.
