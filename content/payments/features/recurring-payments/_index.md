To process recurring payments, MultiSafepay encrypts the customer's sensitive payment details from an initial transaction as a secure, non-sensitive token. For subsequent payments, the customer can select stored details for faster and easier checkout. This is also known as tokenization. 

**Benefits**

- Subsequent payments are exempt from [SCA and 2FA](/payment-regulations/sca/).
- MultiSafepay assumes responsibility for compliant storage of payment details. 
- Customers can store multiple tokens.

**Uses** 

- Easily manage recurring payments and subscriptions. 
- Payment details can autofill at checkout.

## Recurring models
MultiSafepay offers three recurring models:

- **Card on file (COF)**: The cardholder has authorized you to store their card details.
- **Subscription**: An agreement or services that are billed at the end of your billing cycle, e.g. weekly, monthly.
- **Unscheduled**: Event-triggered, e.g. mobile top-up when no credit left on the phone.

Our [SDKs](/developer/wrappers/) support all three models. Our [plugins](/payments/integrations/) use COF only. 

## Via our API
See API reference â€“ [Recurring payments](/api/#recurring-payments-orders).

**Note:** Tokens for SEPA Direct Debit "DIRDEB" transactions are originally received as iDEAL or Sofort transactions.
