To process recurring payments, MultiSafepay encrypts the customer's sensitive payment details for secure storage. The encrypted payment details can be referenced through a non-sensitive identifier, also called 'token'.

In subsequent payments, tokens can be used for:

- **One-click payments**: The customer selects stored details for a frictionless checkout.
- **Subscriptions**: The merchant uses the token to schedule payments periodically.
- **Unscheduled**: The merchant uses the token for event-triggered payments e.g. toppping up an in-app balance.

### Initial payment

During the initial payment, customers are always asked to verify their identity through 3D Secure. Upon processing the payment, we encrypt the payment details for secure storage on our own servers. We return a non-sensitive token which is linked to the encrypted payment details. You can use the token to process recurring payments without needing to handle or store sensitive payment details.

## Recurring models
MultiSafepay offers three recurring models:

- **Card on file (COF)**: The cardholder has authorized you to store their card details.
- **Subscription**: An agreement or services that are billed at the end of your billing cycle, e.g. weekly, monthly.
- **Unscheduled**: Event-triggered, e.g. mobile top-up when no credit left on the phone.

Our [SDKs](/developer/wrappers/) support all three models. Our [plugins](/payments/integrations/) use COF only. 

## Via our API
See API reference â€“ [Recurring payments](/api/#recurring-payments-orders).

**Note:** Tokens for SEPA Direct Debit "DIRDEB" transactions are originally received as iDEAL or Sofort transactions.
