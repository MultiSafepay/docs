Zero Authorization is a MultiSafepay solution that lets you verify credit cards without charging the cardholder. We charge an amount of 0 EUR (with or without [3D Secure](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/glossary/#3d-secure)) to the credit card, store the card details as a token, and then check if the card is legitimate. 

You can then also use the token for [recurring payments](/features/recurring-payments).

Zero Authorization supports Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa, and is available in all countries and currencies.

For how Zero Authorization can benefit your business, see [0-Authorization](https://www.multisafepay.com/blog/manage-your-subscriptions).

## Statuses
