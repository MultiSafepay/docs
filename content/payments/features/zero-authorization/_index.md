Zero Authorization is a MultiSafepay solution that lets you verify a credit card without charging the cardholder. Simply charge an amount of 0 EUR to the credit card (with or without [3D Secure](/glossaries/credit-cards/#3d-secure) authentication). MultiSafepay stores the sensitive payment details as a non-sensitive token, and then checks if the card is legitimate. 

You can then also use tokens for [Recurring Payments](/features/recurring-payments).

Zero Authorization supports Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa, and is available in all countries and currencies.

For how Zero Authorization can benefit your business, see [0-Authorization](https://www.multisafepay.com/blog/manage-your-subscriptions).
