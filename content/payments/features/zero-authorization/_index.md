Zero Authorization is a way of verifying a credit card without charging the cardholder. We charge an amount of 0 EUR (with or without [3D Secure](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/glossary/#3d-secure)) to the credit card, store the card details as a token, and then check if the card is legitimate. 

You can then also use the token for [tokenization](/payments/features/tokenization) or [Recurring Payments](/payments/features/recurring-payments/).

Zero Authorization supports Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa, and is available in all countries and currencies.

For how Zero Authorization can benefit your business, see [0-Authorization](https://www.multisafepay.com/blog/manage-your-subscriptions).

## Statuses

- Order status: indicates the status of the customer's order with the merchant independent of the payment
- Transaction status: indicates the status of settlement in your MultiSafepay balance
