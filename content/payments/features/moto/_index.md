Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO) is a MultiSafepay solution lets you accept credit card payments by manually entering a customer's payment details (provided by phone or email) in your payment gateway via your MultiSafepay account. It supports American Express, Mastercard, and Visa.

## Activating MOTO

The Risk Team then assesses your application, and if approved, activates MOTO in your MultiSafepay account.
