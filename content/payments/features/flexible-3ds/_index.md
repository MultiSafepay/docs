Flexible 3D lets you enable and disable mandatory [3D Secure](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/glossary/) verification of credit card transactions via our API.

For more information about 3D Secure, see [About 3D Secure](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-3d-secure).

Setting Flexible 3D to:

- `false` disables 3D Secure verification and overrides [Dynamic 3D](/payments/features/server-to-server) rules. The payment is classified as **"Not Enrolled, Liability".**

- `true` enables 3D Secure verification and the payment is classified as **3D Secure Result: Enrolled Liability**.

See API Reference:

- [3D disabled or NON 3D transaction](/api/#3d-disabled-or-non-3d-transaction)
- [Direct, Flexible 3D set to false](/api/#direct-flexible-3d-set-on-_false_)
- [Direct Server to Server, Flexible 3D set to true](/api/#direct-server-to-server-flexible-3d-set-on-_true_)
- [Redirect, Flexible 3D set to false](/api/#redirect-flexible-3d-set-on-_false_)
