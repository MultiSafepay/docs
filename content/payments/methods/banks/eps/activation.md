{{< blue-notice >}} If using a ready-made integration: 

- First check that the payment method is supported. 
- Once you have activated the method in your MultiSafepay dashboard, you must also enable it in your [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend).  {{< /blue-notice >}} 

{{< activate_payment_method name="EPS" >}}

{{< alert-notice >}} If the payment method isn't visible in your dashboard, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com> {{< /alert-notice >}}
