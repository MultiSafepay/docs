Customers can request a [chargeback](/payments/chargebacks/) within 56 days, or for unauthorized transactions (i.e. without verifiable consent from the customer) within 13 months. This makes SEPA Direct Debit unsuitable for most retail businesses, e.g. clothing.

You cannot dispute chargebacks and there is no facilitated process like there is for credit card chargebacks. Chargebacks can cost up to 65 EUR in bank fees.
