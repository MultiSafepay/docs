There is a risk that if you refund a customer and they also request a chargeback, you pay their money back twice. Customers can even request a chargeback after successfully receiving a refund.

To reduce the chances of this happening, we strongly recomend:

- Only processing refunds for trusted, verified customers.

- Avoiding refunding a customer if you have any ongoing dispute with them.

- If refunding:

    - First check if the customer has already requested a chargeback.

    - Wait until 7 working days after payment was initiated to be sure payment is now complete.

    - Communicate clearly to the customer that you are sending a refund and that the funds will take a few days to arrive in their account.
