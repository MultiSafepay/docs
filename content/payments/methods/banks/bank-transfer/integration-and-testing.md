**Test a Bank Transfer order**

1. To test a Bank Transfer order, send a [redirect](/api/#bank-transfer---redirect) API request.

| ---------| --------- | ------------------------ |
| NL87ABNA0000000001| **Initialized**/ **Completed** | Transaction is initialized. After 2 minutes, this changes to **Completed**. |
| NL87ABNA0000000002| **Initialized**/ **Expired** | Transaction is initialized. After 2 minutes, this changes to **Expired**. |
| NL87ABNA0000000004| **Initialized**/ **Declined** | Transaction is initialized. After 2 minutes, this changes to **Declined**. |

The transaction status changes to **Void**.

  - Sending a direct API request with an IBAN to test different transaction statuses
- In the live environment it is not possible to accept a refund order. This is done automatically.
