The table below shows a successful payment flow from start to finish.  

{{< details title="About order and transaction statuses" >}}

- Order status: the progression of the customer's order with you, independent of the payment
- Transaction status: the progression towards settlement in your MultiSafepay balance

For more information, see [About MultiSafepay statuses](/payments/multisafepay-statuses/).

{{< /details >}}

|   | Flow | Order status | Transaction status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | The customer initiates a transaction and provides an email address. | Initialized | Initialized |
| 2. | MultiSafepay generates a payment link. |   |  |
| 3. | The customer receives details for a MultiSafepay bank account by email, sent by MultiSafepay or yourself (see below).  |   |  |
| 4. | The customer transfers the funds to the MultiSafepay bank account, either online or with a bank teller. {{< br >}} The funds may take 1 to 3 business days to arrive in our account. | | |
| 5. | MultiSafepay collects the funds and matches the payment to the outstanding transaction. {{< br >}} **Note:** If the customer provides incorrect data and/or pays the wrong amount, we won't link the payment to the outstanding transaction and instead refund the payment to the customer. | Completed | Completed |
| 6. | MultiSafepay adds the funds to your MultiSafepay balance.| | |

{{< details title="Emailing payment instructions yourself" >}}

If emailing your own payment instructions to the customer, in your `POST /orders` API request, set the `disable_send_email` parameter to `true`. 

This prevents MultiSafepay emailing the customer.

For more information, see API Reference â€“ [Bank Transfer: Direct](/api/#direct-bank-transfer).
