iDEAL QR is an additional service offered by the Dutch payment method [iDEAL](/payments/methods/banks/ideal).
 
Customers pay by using their smartphone to scan a QR code, on paper or on screen. This lets you bring offline payments online. 

**Note:** Most Dutch banks have their own QR code on their payment page, but this is not the same as iDEAL QR.

## Product rules

- The lifetime of iDEAL QR payment links is 30 days by default. You can [adjust payment link lifetimes](/api/#adjust-payment-link-lifetimes).

- To set the payment amount using the `min_amount` and `max_amount` parameters in the payment request, see API Reference&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;[iDEAL QR](/api/#ideal-qr).

- You can use the same iDEAL QR code more than once.

- You can generate more than one payment link for a single order ID. Subsequent transactions each have a unique order ID.

{{< details title="Refunds" >}}

- You can refund more than the original transaction value. See [Processing refunds](/tools/multisafepay-control/processing-refunds/).

- There is no time limit on refunding successful transactions, so long as the receiving bank can process the refund.

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- Refunds can only be processed for payments linked to transactions. If no payment is linked to the transaction, the customer receives credit on their invoice instead.

- While the transaction status is **Initialized**, you can cancel the refund. Once the status changes to **Completed**, the refund has been processed. 

- The customer receives the refund in the bank account they originally paid from within the next business day.

- If a refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
