intro_description: "Sofort is a banking payment method by Klarna available in several European countries, and particularly popular in Germany. It integrates directly with the customer's bank like a direct bank transfer. The customer verifies the payment, which reduces the risks associated with traditional transfers. Once a payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it and Sofort guarantees settlement."
