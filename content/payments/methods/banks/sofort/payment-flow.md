## Payment statuses

{{< details title= "About order and transaction statuses" >}}

**Order status:** Changes as the customer's order with you progresses towards shipment (independent of payment)

**Transaction status:** Changes as the funds progress towards settlement in your MultiSafepay balance

For more information, see [About MultiSafepay statuses](/about-payments/multisafepay-statuses/).
