An online banking payment method of two of Belgium's largest banks: CBC which serves the French speaking population, and KBC which serves the Dutch-speaking population.

The payment method functions the same for both the CBC branch and the KBC branch. However, MultiSafepay's payment gateway includes the branches as separate options because customers of one branch can't pay through the other.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| **Countries**  | Belgium  | 
| **Currencies**  | EUR | 
| **Chargebacks**  | No – See [Chargebacks](/payments/chargebacks/). | 
| **Refunds** | [Full and partial](/refunds/full-partial/) {{< br >}} 1 business day after payment is completed |
| **Payment features** | [Second Chance](/features/second-chance/) |
| **Transactions expire after** | 5 days  |

## Notes 

MultiSafepay doesn’t automatically receive the customer's IBAN when a transaction is completed, but we import our bank statements daily. All incoming payments are then completed.
