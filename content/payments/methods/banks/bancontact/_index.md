## Bancontact WIP Service

Bancontact WIP is a wallet initiated payment service you can use for:

- Bancontact One-Click Pay: customer-initiated one-click payments to make checkout faster and increase conversion
- Bancontact Recurring: merchant-initiated subscription payments

### How it works

Bancontact Payconiq gives you access to a merchant wallet to securely store customers' payment details in. Customers give one-time consent and only need to pass [strong customer authentication (SCA)](/payment-regulations/sca/) for their first purchase. 

There is no shift in liability for [chargebacks](/chargebacks/) from [issuer](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#issuer) to [acquirer](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#acquirer) since your fraud and disputes volumes are monitored quarterly. A maximum transaction amount applies. 

### Criteria and activation

- Bancontact WIP is only available to low-risk, high-volume merchants (25,000 transactions quarterly), within the SEPA area. 
- Applies to services only, not physical products. 
- You must have easy-to-use procedures in place for refunds, cancellations, and disputes.
- Customers must be able to add, update, and delete their stored payment details.  
- You must be able to continually demonstrate low rates of fraudulent transactions, or access to your merchant wallet may be revoked.
