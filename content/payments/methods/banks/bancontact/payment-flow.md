## How it works

{{< mermaid class="text-center" >}}

sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Customer
    participant Mu as MultiSafepay
    participant CB as Customer's bank
    participant Me as Merchant

    C->>Mu: Selects Bancontact (QR) at checkout
    Mu->>C: Connects to customer's bank (redirect only)
    C->>CB: Authenticates account/scans QR code and completes payment
    CB->>Mu: Transfers funds 
    Mu->>Me: Settles funds 

{{< /mermaid >}}

{{< details title="Redirect flow">}}

The customer selects Bancontact at checkout and is redirected first to a MultiSafepay payment page to select their bank, and then to their online banking environment. 

See API reference â€“ [Bancontact](/api/#bancontact).

## Payment statuses

{{< details title="Order and transaction statuses" >}}
For each payment in your MultiSafepay account, there are two statuses that change as payment progresses:

**Order status**  
The progression of the customer's order with you, independent of the payment
  
**Transaction status**  
The progression towards settling the funds in your MultiSafepay balance

For more information, see [About MultiSafepay statuses](/payments/multisafepay-statuses/).
