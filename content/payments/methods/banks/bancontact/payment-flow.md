The table below shows a successful payment flow from start to finish.  

{{< details title="About order and transaction statuses" >}}

In your MultiSafepay account > **Transaction overview** > **Transaction details** page under **Status history**, there are two statuses that change as the flow progresses: 

- Order status: indicates the status of the customer's order with the merchant independent of the payment
- Transaction status: indicates the status of settlement in your MultiSafepay balance

{{< /details >}}

|   | Flow | Order status | Transaction status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | The customer initiates a transaction. | Initialized | Initialized |
| 2. | MultiSafepay generates a payment link. |   |  |
| 3. | The customer authenticates their account, and completes the payment. | | |
| 4. | The transaction is successful. {{< br >}} It cannot be reversed by the customer and settlement is guaranteed. |  |  |
| 5. | MultiSafepay collects the funds and adds them to your MultiSafepay balance.| Completed | Completed |

## Unsuccessful statuses

| Description | Order status | Transaction status |
|---|---|---|
| Bancontact has declined the transaction. | Declined | Declined   |
| The transaction has been cancelled. | Void   | Cancelled   |
| The customer didn't complete the payment and the transaction expired after the predetermined period. | Expired | Expired |
