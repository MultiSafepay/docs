[iDEAL](https://www.ideal.nl/en/) is the leading payment method in the Netherlands and links all major Dutch retail banks. 

Customers pay via mobile banking app, QR code, or in their own online banking environment. 

Once a payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it and iDEAL guarantees settlement.

To increase transparency for customers, the name of your website appears on the iDEAL payment page and "Your-website-name by MultiSafepay" on the customer's bank statement.

## iDEAL QR
 
iDEAL QR has a wide range of applications. Customers can scan QR codes off screens or paper, e.g. invoices, receipts. This makes it particularly suitable for hospitality, charity collectors, and home deliveries. 

For more information, see iDEAL – [Offer iDEAL QR](https://www.ideal.nl/en/businesses/offer-ideal-qr/).

- iDEAL QR is supported in all our [ready-made integrations](/payments/integrations/). 

- Not all Dutch banking apps support iDEAL QR yet, so we recommend that customers scan QR codes with their camera or a general QR reader. This redirects to the ideal.nl payment page, which works for all banks. 

- You can specify whether the same QR code can be used more than once.

- You can let customers change the amount to pay, e.g. for donations.
