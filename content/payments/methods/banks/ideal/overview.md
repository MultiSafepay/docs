iDEAL is the leading payment method in the Netherlands and links all major Dutch retail banks. 

Customers pay via mobile banking app, QR code, or in their own online banking environment. 

Once a payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it and iDEAL guarantees settlement.

To increase transparency for customers, the name of your website appears on the iDEAL payment page and "Your-website-name by MultiSafepay" on the customer's bank statement.
