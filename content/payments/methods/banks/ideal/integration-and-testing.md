To process payments via our API, see API reference:

- [iDEAL](/api/#ideal)
- [iDEAL QR](/api/#ideal-qr)

## iDEAL QR

MultiSafepay supports seamless integration for iDEAL QR. You can:

- Retrieve and process the PNG image for the QR code in your system to display it to the customer.  

- Redirect the customer to a [MultiSafepay payment page](/payment-pages/) where the iDEAL QR code is displayed under **Payment methods**.

- Generate a generic link that can be used multiple times. 

- Print a QR code, e.g. on leaflets or menus. 

You can enable an option to allow the customer change the amount.

Only 4 Dutch banks support iDEAL QR in their own banking app: Knab, Rabobank, ING, and ABN AMRO. Customers of other banks must use the iDEAL app.
