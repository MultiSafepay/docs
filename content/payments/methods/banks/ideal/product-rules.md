{{< details title="Refunds" >}}
- [Full and partial refunds](/payments/refunds/) are supported.

- You cannot refund more than the amount of the original transaction.

- There is no time limit on refunding successful transactions, so long as the receiving bank can process the refund.

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- Refunds can only be processed for payments linked to transactions. If no payment is linked to the transaction, the customer receives credit on their invoice instead.

- While the transaction status is **Initialized**, you can cancel the refund. Once the status changes to **Completed**, the refund has been processed. 

- The customer receives the refund in the bank account they originally paid from within the next business day.

- If a refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
