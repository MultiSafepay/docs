Request to Pay is a Deutsche Bank payment method, previously known as Direct Bank Transfer, based on the PSD2 Open Banking API. Customers are redirected to Deutsche Bank online banking, authenticate themselves, and authorize a secure SEPA transfer. 

Settlement is instant (if supported) or within 24 hours. The funds are transferred directly to your business bank account, instead of your MultiSafepay balance, which simplifies reconciliation.
