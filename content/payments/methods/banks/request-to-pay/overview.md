Request to Pay is a Deutsche Bank payment method based on the PSD2 Open Banking API. 

Customers are redirected to Deutsche Bank online banking, authenticate themselves, and authorize a secure SEPA transfer. Settlement is instant (if supported) or within 24&nbsp;hours. 

The funds are transferred directly to your business bank account, instead of your MultiSafepay balance, which simplifies reconciliation.
