{{< details title="Refunds" >}}

- MultiSafepay doesnâ€™t automatically receive the IBAN when a transaction is completed, but we import our bank statements daily. All incoming payments are then completed. You can process refunds after 1 business day.

- You can refund more than the original transaction value. See [Processing refunds](/tools/multisafepay-control/processing-refunds/).

- There is no time limit on refunding successful transactions, so long as the receiving bank can process the refund.

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- While the transaction status is **Initialized**, you can cancel the refund. Once the status changes to **Completed**, the refund has been processed. 

- The customer receives the refund in the bank account they originally paid from within the next business day.

- If a refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
