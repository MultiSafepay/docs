{{< alert-notice >}} **Attention Dutch merchants** <br> Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/about-payments/surcharges/) to pay later methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). <br> We therefore strongly recommend discontinuing any surcharges. <br> For more information, email <sales@multisafepay.com> {{< /alert-notice >}}
