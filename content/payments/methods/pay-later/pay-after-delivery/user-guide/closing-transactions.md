If a customer pays for an order into your business bank account directly instead of paying MultiFactor, you need to manually change the transaction status to **Completed**. This stops MultiFactor sending the customer payment requests.   

To close a transaction manually, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transaction overview**.
3. Search for the transaction and click to open the **Transaction details** page.
4. Click **Complete own funds**. 
5. Enter a comment about what happened with the order. 
6. Click **Complete**.  
    The total amount of the transaction is deducted from your MultiSafepay balance. The invoice is considered settled.
