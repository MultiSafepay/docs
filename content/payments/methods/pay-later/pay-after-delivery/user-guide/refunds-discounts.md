Pay After Delivery supports: 

- [Full and partial refunds](/refunds/full-partial/)
- [Discounts](/refunds/discounts/)
- [API refunds](/refunds/pay-later-refunds) 

## Refund guidance

- You can't process refunds after the invoice is passed to a collection agency (usually 6 weeks after shipping the order). This is not visible in your MultiSafepay account. To check when the invoice was passed to the agency, email <support@multifactor.nl>

- You can't see whether the customer has paid the invoice. If they have already paid, they receive a refund. If not, they receive an adjusted payment request or the invoice is cancelled.

- For both full and partial refunds, any additional administration costs for the customer are deducted from the invoice. The customer has a further 14 days to complete the payment. 

- You cannot reverse full refunds.
