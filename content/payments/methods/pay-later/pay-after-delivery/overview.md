Pay After Delivery is MultiSafepay's own pay later method that lets customers pay for orders after receiving them, increasing customer confidence and conversion. 

Customers are only charged for the items they keep. MultiSafepay bears the risk, based on the customer's history, and guarantees settlement.

## Notes

- Minimum and maximum order amounts apply. For more information, email your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

- The delivery and invoice addresses must be the **same** to prevent fraud. For&nbsp;more information, see MultiFactor – [Shipping policies](https://www.multifactor.nl/voorwaarden/shipping-policies).

## Refunds

- You can't process refunds after the invoice is transfered to a collection agency (usually 6 weeks after shipping the order). **Shipped** status is not visible in your MultiSafepay account. To check the date of shipment, email <support@multifactor.nl>

- You can't see whether the customer has paid the invoice. If they have already paid, they receive a refund. If not, they receive an adjusted payment request or the invoice is cancelled.

- For both full and partial refunds, any additional administration costs for the customer are deducted from the invoice. The customer has a further 14 days to complete the payment. 

-  You cannot reverse full refunds.
