## Overview

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| **Countries**  | The Netherlands â€“ in3 checks the customer's country, and billing/shipping address to confirm.  | 
| **Currencies**  | EUR  | 
| **Chargebacks**  | No  | 
| **Refunds** | [Full, partial, and API refunds](/refunds/pay-later/), [discounts](/refunds/discounts/) {{< br >}} You can request in3 to process a full or partial refund, either before payout or up to 1&nbsp;year afterwards. |
| **Supports** | [Second Chance](/features/second-chance/) |
| **Transactions expire after** | 2 hours |
| **Amount limits** | Min: 100 EUR Max: 3000 EUR <br> You can adjust these limits in the backend of our [ready-made integrations](/integrations/ready-made/) to show or hide in3 on your checkout page depending on the order value. |
| **Addresses** | Different billing and shipping addresses are supported. |

### Surcharges

Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/about-payments/surcharges/) to pay later methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM).  

We therefore strongly recommend **not** applying surcharges.

### Shipping orders

When you ship the order, you can change the order status to **Shipped** for your records, bu this is not required to trigger invoicing.

{{< details title="Changing order status to Shipped" >}}

You can change the [order status](/about-payments/multisafepay-statuses/) from **Completed** to **Shipped**:

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
3. Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
4. Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
5. Change the status to **Shipped**.
6. Send the customer the track and trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status in your backend, the following [ready-made integrations](/integrations/ready-made/) pass the updated status to your dashboard automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/updateorder) API request.

**Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.

### Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and in, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. 

This is because in3 collects and require precise order specifications. Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.
