[in3](https://payin3.eu/en/) is a Dutch online payment method where customers pay in 3 installments after receiving their order, at no extra cost and without having to register with the Bureau Krediet Registratie (BKR). in3 processes all the installments and guarantees settlement after receiving the first one.

## Overview

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| **Countries**  | The Netherlands â€“ in3 checks the customer's country, and billing/shipping address to confirm.  | 
| **Currencies**  | EUR  | 
| **Chargebacks**  | No  | 
| **Refunds** | [Full, partial, and API refunds](/refunds/pay-later/), [discounts](/refunds/discounts/) {{< br >}} You can request in3 to process a full or partial refund, either before payout or up to 1&nbsp;year afterwards. |

| **Addresses** | Different billing and shipping addresses are supported. |
| **Gift cards** | [Gift cards and pay later methods](/payment-methods/gift-cards/pay-later-methods/) |

{{< alert-notice >}} **Surcharges**  
Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/about-payments/surcharges/) to pay later methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM).  

We therefore strongly recommend **not** applying surcharges.
