| **Direct flow** | The customer is redirected straight to in3 to select their bank, and accept the payment periods and terms and conditions. | [API reference](/api/#in3---direct) |
| **Redirect flow** | The customer is redirected to a [MultiSafepay payment page](/payment-pages/) to provide their birth date, title, and phone number. {{< br >}} They are then redirected to your success page. | [API reference](/api/#in3---redirect) |

## Payment statuses

**Order status**: Changes as the customer's order with you progresses towards shipment (independent of payment)

**Transaction status**: Changes as the funds progress towards settlement in your MultiSafepay balance

| Description | Order status | Transaction status |
|---|---|---|
| The customer has initiated a transaction. {{< br >}} You can still cancel it. | Initialized   | Initialized  |
| in3 is authorizing the payment or waiting for the customer to pay the first installment. {{< br >}} The customer has 5 minutes to pay the first installment, or the transaction is cancelled. {{< br >}} The first installment is required to create the order. | Uncleared  | Initialized  |
| The customer has paid the first installment. {{< br >}} Settlement is now guaranteed. {{< br >}} You can no longer cancel. You can only refund. | Completed  | Uncleared  |
| **Important:** Manually change the order status to **Shipped** (see below).  | Shipped | Uncleared | 
| The transaction is complete. | Completed | Completed |
| in3 has declined the payment. {{< br >}} No order was created. | Declined | Declined |
| The transaction is cancelled. | Void | Void |
| The transaction expired after 2 hours | Expired | Expired |

{{< details title="Changing order status to Shipped" >}}

Changing the order status from **Completed** to **Shipped** prevents the order expiring, and triggers in3 to invoice customer and transfer the funds to MultiSafepay. 

**In your MultiSafepay account**

To change the order status in your MultiSafepay account, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
3. Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
4. Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
5. Change the status to **Shipped**.
6. Send the customer the Track & Trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status to **Shipped** in your [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend), some MultiSafepay plugins can pass the updated status to your MultiSafepay account automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other MultiSafepay plugins, you can forward the status via our API by making a `PATCH /orders` request. 

Some third-party plugins may not support forwarding the status via our API. 

See API reference â€“ [Update an order](/api/#update-an-order).
