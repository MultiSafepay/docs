[Betaal per Maand](https://www.santander.nl/veelgestelde-vragen/betaal-per-maand) is a MultiSafepay pay later method for large amounts in collaboration with Santander. Customers pay for orders after receiving them as a one-off payment or in monthly installments. They are only charged for the items they keep. Santander bears the risk and guarantees settlement.

**Order status:** Changes as the customer's order with you progresses towards shipment (independent of payment)

**Transaction status:** Changes as the funds progress towards settlement in your MultiSafepay balance

For more information, see [Payment statuses](/payments/payment-statuses/).

| Payments | Order status | Transaction status |
|---|---|---|
| The customer has been redirected to Santander. <br> To cancel, email <support@multisafepay.com> | Initialized   | Initialized  |
| The customer has completed the pre-form and Santander is authorizing the transaction. | Uncleared | Initialized |
| Santander has authorized the transaction and the funds are awaiting capture. <br> (You can no longer cancel; you can only refund.) | Completed  | Uncleared  |
| **Important:** To capture the funds, manually change the order status to Shipped and send us the track-and-trace code (see [Providing track-and-trace codes](/payment-methods/betaal-per-maand/#providing-track-and-trace-codes)).  | Shipped | Uncleared |
| MultiSafepay has collected payment. | Shipped    | Completed  |
| Santander declined the transaction. <br> Only the customer can contact them to find out why (for privacy and compliance reasons). | Declined   | Declined   |
| You cancelled the transaction before capture.   | Void   | Void   |
| The customer didn't complete payment or the funds weren't captured within 1&nbsp;day. | Expired | Expired  |

### Changing orders before shipment

You can still change an order between approval from Santander and shipment.

{{< details title="Changing orders before shipment" >}}

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transaction overview**.
3. Search for the transaction and click to open the **Transaction details** page.
4. Under **Order summary**, click **Change order status**.
5. Change the status of the initial order to **Shipped**, and then add a **Memo**.
6. Refund the required amount [in full or in part](/refunds/full-partial/). 

You cannot increase the amount of the initial order by default. Email a request to <sales@multisafepay.com>

{{< /details >}}

### Shipping orders

When you ship the order, you **must** manually change the [order status](/about-payments/multisafepay-statuses/) from **Completed** to **Shipped** to:

- Capture the funds
- Trigger sending the invoice to the customer
- Prevent the order from expiring

{{< details title="Changing order status to shipped" >}}

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
3. Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
4. Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
5. Change the status to **Shipped**.
6. Send the customer the track and trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status in your backend, the following [ready-made integrations](/integrations/ready-made/) pass the updated status to your dashboard automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/updateorder) API request.

**Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.

{{< /details >}}

### Providing track-and-trace codes

You can provide track-and-trace codes to MultiSafepay:

- In your dashboard when you change the order status to Shipped, **or**  
- Via our API. See API reference â€“ [Update order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/updateorder) > Ship order.

### Pauzing the collection period

If the return process takes too long to verify, you can pauze the collection period for 2 to 4 weeks. Contact Betaal per Maand.

{{< details title="Gift cards" >}}

When paying with a gift card and Betaal per Maand, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. 

This is because Santander collects and require precise order specifications. Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Known errors" >}}

The customer's first and last name, and the delivery details must be at least 2 characters long. Anything shorter can cause errors. 

We recommend always requiring full names, not initials, abbreviations, or acronyms.
