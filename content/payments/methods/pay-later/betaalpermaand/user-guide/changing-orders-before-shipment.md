1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transaction overview**.
3. Search for the transaction and click to open the **Transaction details** page.
4. Under **Order summary**, click **Change order status**.
5. Change the status of the initial order to **Shipped**, and then add a **Memo**.
6. Refund the required amount fully or partially. See [Processing refunds](/payments/methods/billing-suite/betaalpermaand/#processing-refunds).
