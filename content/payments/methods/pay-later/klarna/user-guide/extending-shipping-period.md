If you cannot ship the order within 28 days, you can extend the time period for up to 180 days in segments in your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) via the **Extend** button.

If the order is not captured during this time, both the [order and transaction status](/about-payments/multisafepay-statuses/) changes to **Expired**.
