Changing the order status from **Completed** to **Shipped** prevents the order expiring, and triggers Klarna to invoice the customer and transfer the funds to MultiSafepay. 

## In your MultiSafepay account

To change the order status in your MultiSafepay account, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
3. Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
4. Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
5. Change the status to **Shipped**.
6. Send the customer the Track & Trace details, if relevant.

## In your backend

Some MultiSafepay plugins can pass the updated status to your MultiSafepay account automatically when you set the order status in your [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend) to:

- Magento 2: **Shipped** 
- Shopware 5: **Completed**
- WooCommerce: **Completed**

For other MultiSafepay plugins, you can forward the status via our API by making a `PATCH /orders` request. Some third-party plugins may not support this. 

See API reference â€“ [Update an order](/api/#update-an-order).
