A dispute is when you and a customer disagree about an order:

- Goods, e.g. the customer returns all or part of the order, or the goods were faulty when delivered
- Payments, e.g. invoicing errors, or the customer paid Klarna instead of you
- Other, e.g. insolvency, or bankruptcy

Klarna provides support for resolving disputes. For a step-by-step overview, see Klarna – [How to handle disputes at Klarna](https://docs.klarna.com/disputes/).

The easiest way to handle disputes is using the Disputes app in the Klarna Merchant Portal. The portal also gives you an overview of all your orders. 

{{< blue-notice >}} **Note:** If viewing orders in the portal, you must still manually [change the order status to Shipped](/payment-methods/klarna/changing-order-status-to-shipped/) to trigger the invoicing process and receive payment. {{< /blue-notice >}}

## Connecting to the Klarna Merchant Portal

You'll receive an email from Klarna inviting you to activate your portal account. 

{{< blue-notice >}} **Note:** The link expires within 3 days and is only usable once. If your link has expired or you haven't received an email, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com> {{< /blue-notice >}}

1. In the email, click **Activate account**.
2. Read the Merchant Portal Agreement, agree to the terms and conditions, and then click **Continue**.
3. Enter a password, and click **Update password**.
4. Enter your first and last names, and then click **Update profile**.
5. To sign in for the first time, enter your email address and the password you just created, and then click **Log in**.

### Setting up two-factor authentication

If you want to increase the security of your account, set up two-factor authentication with the Google Authenticator app.

1. Under **To-dos**, click **Activate two-factor authentication**. 
2. In the dialog, click **Start the setup**.
3. Open the Google Authenticator app and scan the QR code. 
4. Enter the one-time authorization code from the app, and click **Set up authentication**.
