[Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/) is a flexible online payment method that lets customers pay now, later, or in installments. Customers are only charged for the items they keep from the order. Klarna bears the risk and guarantees settlement.

## Customer addresses


The customer's billing and shipping addresses must be the **same**.

## Surcharges

Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/about-payments/surcharges/) to pay later methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). We therefore strongly recommend discontinuing any surcharges.
