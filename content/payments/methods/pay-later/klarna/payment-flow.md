[Direct flow](/api/#afterpay---direct)  
The customer selects AfterPay at checkout and is redirected straight to AfterPay.  

[Redirect flow](/api/#afterpay---redirect)  
The customer:

- Selects AfterPay at checkout and is redirected to a MultiSafepay payment page 
- Provides their birthdate, email address, and phone number, and accepts the terms and conditions
- Is redirected to your success page

## Payment statuses

{{< details title="Order and transaction statuses" >}}
For each payment in your MultiSafepay account, there are two statuses that change as payment progresses:

**Order status**  
The progression of the customer's order with you, independent of the payment

**Transaction status**  
The progression towards settling the funds in your MultiSafepay balance

For more information, see [About MultiSafepay statuses](/payments/multisafepay-statuses/).

| Description | Order status | Transaction status |

| 1. | The customer selects Klarna at checkout and is redirected to the Klarna payment page to initiate a transaction. {{< br >}} See also [Reservation and invoice numbers](/payments/methods/billing-suite/klarna/user-guide/reservation-and-invoice-number/). | Uncleared   | Initialized  |
| 2. | Klarna authorizes the payment. Settlement is now guaranteed, but not received until after you ship the order. | Completed  | Uncleared  |
| 3. | Ship the order within 28 days, or [extend the shipping period](/payments/methods/billing-suite/klarna/user-guide/extending-shipping-period/). {{< br >}} You **must**: {{< br >}} - Ship the order to receive payment. {{< br >}} - Manually [change the order status to Shipped](/payments/methods/billing-suite/klarna/user-guide/changing-order-status-to-shipped/). {{< br >}} See also [Supported addresses](/payments/methods/billing-suite/klarna/user-guide/supported-addresses/). | Shipped | Uncleared |

## Unsuccessful statuses
You can cancel payments before the funds are captured. After the funds are captured you can only process a refund.
