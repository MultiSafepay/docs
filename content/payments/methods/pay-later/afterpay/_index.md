{{< alert-notice >}} **Note for Dutch merchants** <br> Due to changes to the Consumer Credit Act (Wet op het consumentenkrediet), merchants who apply [surcharges](https://docs.multisafepay.com/about-payments/surcharges/) to pay later methods are now deemed credit providers. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). <br> AfterPay therefore strongly recommends discontinuing any surcharges as of February 18, 2022. <br> For more information, see AfterPay â€“ [Merchant support](https://www.afterpay.nl/nl/consumenten/vraag-en-antwoord/). {{< /alert-notice >}}
