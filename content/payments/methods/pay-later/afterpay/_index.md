{{< alert-notice >}} **Attention Dutch merchants** <br> Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/about-payments/surcharges/) to pay later methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). <br> AfterPay therefore strongly recommends discontinuing any surcharges. <br> For more information, see AfterPay â€“ [Merchant support](https://www.afterpay.nl/nl/consumenten/vraag-en-antwoord/). {{< /alert-notice >}}
