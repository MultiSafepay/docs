|---|---|---|
| **Direct flow** | The customer is redirected straight to AfterPay. | [API reference](/api/#afterpay---direct) |
| **Redirect flow** | The customer is redirected to a [MultiSafepay payment page](/payment-pages/) to accept the terms and conditions and provide their birth date, email address, and phone number. {{< br >}} They are then redirected to your success page. | [API reference](/api/#afterpay---redirect) |

## Payment statuses

**Order status**: Changes as the customer's order with you progresses towards shipment (independent of payment)

**Transaction status**: Changes as the funds progress towards settlement in your MultiSafepay balance

| Description | Order status | Transaction status |
|---|---|---|
| AfterPay is authorizing the payment. {{< br >}} You can still cancel it. | Uncleared | Uncleared |
| MultiSafepay has sent a capture to AfterPay. {{< br >}} You can no longer cancel. You can only refund. | Completed  | Uncleared  |
| **Important:** Manually change the order status to **Shipped** (see below). {{< br >}} You must ship to receive payment. | Shipped | Uncleared |
| The transaction is complete. | Shipped | Completed |
| AfterPay has declined the payment **or** the payment was cancelled. {{< br >}} AfterPay only provides the reason directly to the customer, for privacy and compliance reasons.  | Void | Cancelled |
| You did not ship within 90 days of creating the transaction and it expired. | Expired | Expired |

{{< details title="Changing the order status to Shipped" >}}
 
Changing the order status from **Completed** to **Shipped** prevents the order expiring, and triggers AfterPay to invoice customer and transfer the funds to MultiSafepay. 

**In your MultiSafepay account**

To change the order status in your MultiSafepay account, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
3. Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
4. Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
5. Change the status to **Shipped**.
6. Send the customer the track and trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status to **Shipped** in your [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend), some MultiSafepay plugins can pass the updated status to your MultiSafepay account automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other MultiSafepay plugins, you can forward the status via our API by making a `PATCH /orders` request. 

Some third-party plugins may not support forwarding the status via our API. 

See API reference â€“ [Update an order](/api/#update-an-order).

### Return process
If the customer returns some items from the order and this takes a long time to verify, you can pauze the collection period for 2 to 4 weeks. 

Phone **+31 207 230 230** or email <merchant@afterpay.com> 

## Refund statuses

| Description | Order status | Transaction status |
|---|---|---|
| The customer has requested a refund. | Initialized    | Completed   |
| The refund is complete.  | Completed      | Completed   |
