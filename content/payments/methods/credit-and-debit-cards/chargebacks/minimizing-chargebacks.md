The best way of minimizing chargebacks is providing good customer service.

We set out below ways to minimize the risk of the most common types of chargeback: 

## Fraud
Use [3D Secure](/glossaries/credit-cards/#3d-secure) for all credit card transactions. 

Cardholders are not allowed to request chargebacks due to fraud for 3D Secure-protected transactions.  

## Non-delivery
- Inform customers of both expected and actual delivery times
 - Document the delivery process, e.g. use Track & Trace with signature
 - Refund or cancel transactions if the goods won't arrive within the stated delivery time or not at all. 

## Goods not as described  
Offer quality items and provide clear descriptions on your website. 

## Transaction not recognized

To help increase brand recognition, include your logo in customer's online bank statments. See [Your logo in online banking](/about-payments/logos-in-online-banking/).

## Your logo in customers' online banking

Displaying your logo in customers' online banking environments and applications can help improve your brand presence, recognition, and trust. This in turn helps reduce chargebacks, disputes, and friendly fraud â€“ when customers mistakenly initiate chargebacks because they don't recognise or trust a transaction.

[Upload your logo](https://logo.ethoca.com/) for the [card scheme](/glossaries/credit-cards/#card-scheme) to display in all participating banking environments and applications.
