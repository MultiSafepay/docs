The best way of minimizing chargebacks is providing good customer service.

We set out below ways to minimize the risk of the most common types of chargeback: 

## Fraud
Use [3D Secure](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/glossary/) for all credit card transactions. 

Cardholders are not allowed to request chargebacks due to fraud for 3D Secure-protected transactions.  

## Non-delivery
- Inform customers of both expected and actual delivery times
 - Document the delivery process, e.g. use Track & Trace with signature
 - Refund or cancel transactions if the goods won't arrive within the stated delivery time or not at all. 

## Goods not as described  
Offer quality items and provide clear descriptions on your website.
