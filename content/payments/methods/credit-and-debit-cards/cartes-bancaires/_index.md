[Cartes Bancaires](https://www.cartes-bancaires.com/) is a popular Visa-branded credit card in France. 

An additional layer of security is provided by Verified by Visa (Visa's version of [3D Secure](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-3d-secure/)), which requires cardholders to verify their identity.
