{{< blue-notice >}} If using a ready-made integration: 

- First check that the payment method is supported. 
- Once activated for your account, you must also enable the payment method in your [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).  {{< /blue-notice >}}

1. Email a request to activate the credit or debit card to <sales@multisafepay.com>

    Include the following information:

- Average, minimum, and maximum transaction amount
- Annual turnover in credit card, debit card, and direct debit payments respectively (Specify an amount for each of these types of payment, even if is a zero (0) amount.)

2. The Risk Team checks your eligibilty and if approved, activates the card for your account.
