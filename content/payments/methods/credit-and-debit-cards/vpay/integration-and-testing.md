## Integration

| | |
|---|---|
| **API** | See API reference – [Create order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder) > Card order. See also Examples > Visa redirect. {{< br >}} **Bundled credit cards** {{< br >}} You can also bundle multiple credit cards together on your MultiSafepay credit card payment page. This saves space in your checkout. Customers enter their payment details and the page detects the specific card scheme based on the first four digits. {{< br >}} See API reference – [Create order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder) > Card order. See also Examples > Credit card redirect. |
| **Ready-made integrations** | You can integrate using the Visa gateway (redirect) in all our [ready-made integrations](/integrations/ready-made/).   |
| **Checkout options** | [Payment Components](/payment-components/) (embedded) {{< br >}} [Multisafepay payment pages](/payment-pages/) (hosted) {{< br >}} [Payment links](/payment-links/about/) – You can adjust the lifetime. |
| **Logo** | See MultiSafepay GitHub – [MultiSafepay icons](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/MultiSafepay-icons). {{< br >}} The V Pay logo never appears on MultiSafepay payment pages because it's part of the Visa Europe circuit. |
