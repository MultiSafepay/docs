Dankort payments are processed through the Visa gateway.

To make Dankort available as a payment method on the MultiSafepay credit card payment page, you need to:

- Ensure you have enabled the Visa gateway.
- Set the [`locale`](/developer/api/using-locale-parameters) to `da_DK` (Denmark) in transaction requests.

Download the Dankort logo from the [MultiSafepay logo collection](/faq/general/where-find-logo-payment-methods) and upload it to your ecommerce platform.
