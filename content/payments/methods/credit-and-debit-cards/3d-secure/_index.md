3D Secure 2.0 (3DS2) is an authentication protocol card schemes use to verify cardholder identity for online credit and debit card payments. Under [PSD2](/payment-regulations/psd2/), MultiSafepay is required to apply it to **all** Europe-based card payments, and we enable it by default for non-EU payments as well. 

3DS2 provides an extra layer of security and helps reduce fraud-related [chargebacks](/chargebacks/). If a transaction is successfully authenticated using 3DS2, the card scheme is responsible for chargeback costs instead of you.

## How it works

**1.** The cardholder enters their payment details and is redirected to the card scheme to authenticate using their branded version of 3DS2: 

- American Express Safekey
- Mastercard SecureCode
- Verified by Visa

**2.** Contextual information from the customer's device (fingerprint) is shared with you and the scheme to conduct a risk assessment, e.g.:

- Transaction value
- New or existing customer
- Customer's location and/or transaction history

**3.** You and the scheme each decide whether to request additional authentication:

- **Frictionless flow:** The transaction appears legitimate and is authorized without further user-side authentication. 
- **Challenge flow:** The transaction appears risky and the cardholder is asked to provide additional authentication, e.g. password, SMS code, fingerprint.

## Exemptions

To help you optimize conversion and manage risk, MultiSafepay supports exemptions from 3DS2 and [strong customer authentication](/payment-regulations/psd2/) (SCA). Under the PSD2, some exemptions are only supported **outside** of Europe.

{{< alert-notice >}} Exemptions remove an important layer of security and increase the risk of fraud. You are then liable for any fraud-related chargebacks. {{< /alert-notice>}}

### Merchant-initiated transactions

Merchant-initiated transactions are [recurring payments](/features/recurring-payments) initiated by the merchant on behalf of the customer, based on a prior agreement. Examples of merchant-initiated transactions include subscription payments and automatic balance top-ups. 

Merchant-initiated transactions do not require 3D Secure 2.0 authentication.

### Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO)
 
For [MOTO](https://docs.multisafepay.com/features/moto/) payments, the customer provides their card details to the merchant over the phone or by email. These payments do not require 3D Secure 2.0 authentication. 
### Transaction risk analysis

MultiSafepay can conduct a transaction risk analysis (TRA) for specific transactions for amounts up to EUR&nbsp;500. The issuer may soft decline the exemption, in which case the customer is automatically redirected to authenticate.
