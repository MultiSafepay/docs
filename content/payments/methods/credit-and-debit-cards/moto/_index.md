Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO) is a MultiSafepay solution that lets you process card-not-present payments over the phone or by email. 

## How it works

The customer provides their card details to you over the phone or by email. 

Since MOTO skips [3D Secure](/features/3d-secure/about) authentication, you bear the increased risk of fraud. To&nbsp;help ensure the customer is the cardholder, ask them to provide as much identifying information as possible, e.g.:

- Full name
- Address
- Phone numbers
- Email address
- Name of bank
- A copy of their signature on some correspondence, e.g. a scanned order confirmation

You handle the transaction via your MultiSafepay dashboard or our API.
