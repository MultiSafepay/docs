This page provides general guidance on refunding credit card payments. 

## Refund rules

- You **cannot** refund more than the original transaction. 

- MultiSafepay sends refunds to the [issuer](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#issuer) within 1 business day.

- Whether or not the refund is visible to the customer depends on the issuer's system.

- Depending on the issuer, the amount may not appear directly on the customer's card. We recommend that they contact the issuer. If they need an [acquirer reference number (ARN)](/credit-cards-user-guide/glossary/#acquirer-reference-number-arn), they can email <support@multisafepay.com> 

- You can process refunds via MultiSafepay for up to 180 days after payment was completed. 

## Reversals

If you process a partial refund on the same day, this is technically called a "reversal", but for simplicity is logged as a refund in your MultiSafepay dashboard. 

On the customer's credit card statement, the transaction may either be:

- Adjusted to the new amount= Partial reversal
- Not debited at all= Full reversal
