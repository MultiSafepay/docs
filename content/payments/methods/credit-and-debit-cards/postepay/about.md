Postepay is a popular Visa or Mastercard-branded credit card in Italy. An additional layer of security is provided by Verified by Visa or or MasterCard SecureCode (branded versions of [3D Secure](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-3d-secure/)), which require cardholders to verify their identity.
