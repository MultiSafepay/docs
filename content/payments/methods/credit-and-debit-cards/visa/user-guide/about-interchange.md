Banks and card schemes all charge different fees to cover the operational costs of managing their network and processing credit card payments.

The actual cost of a specific transaction is difficult to predict. Fees differ per transaction, based on factors such as the:

* Country where the card was issued
* Country where the transaction is processed
* Type of card, e.g. corporate or customer card
* Way the card is processed, e.g. level of security
* Amount of the transaction

To ensure transparency, payment service providers can choose the Interchange++ pricing model, which breaks down the costs for each transaction. There are no preset prices, instead the fee is calculated based on the total cost of all transactions processed.
