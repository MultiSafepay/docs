Displaying your logo in customers' online banking environments and applications can help improve your brand presence, recognition, and trust. This in turn helps reduce chargebacks, disputes, and friendly fraud â€“ when customers mistakenly initiate chargebacks because they don't recognise or trust a transaction.

[Upload your logo](https://logo.ethoca.com/) for Visa to display in all participating banking environments and applications.
