There are two options for integrating Visa, depending on whether you want to accept multiple credit cards or Visa only. 

#### Multiple credit cards
 
Customers are redirected to a MultiSafepay credit card payment page, where all credit cards are bundled together. This saves space in your checkout. Customers enter their payment details and the page detects the specific card scheme based on the first four digits.

See API reference – [Credit cards](/api/#credit-cards).

#### Visa only
Customers are redirected straight to Visa. 

See API reference – [Mastercard](/api/#mastercard).
