{{< details title="Embedded vs redirect">}}

**Embedded solution**   
The customer selects Cartes Bancaires and enters their payment details at checkout.  
See [Payment Components](/payment-components/).

**Redirect flow**  
The customer selects Cartes Bancaires at checkout and is redirected to a MultiSafepay payment page to enter their payment details.  
See API reference â€“ [Co-branded credit cards](/api/#co-branded-credit-cards). 

{{< /details>}}

**Note:** Verified by Visa is Visa's version of [3D Secure](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-3d-secure/).

## Payment statuses

{{< details title="Order and transaction statuses" >}}
For each payment in your MultiSafepay account, there are two statuses that change as payment progresses:

**Order status**  
The progression of the customer's order with you, independent of the payment

**Transaction status**  
The progression towards settling the funds in your MultiSafepay balance

For more information, see [About MultiSafepay statuses](/payments/multisafepay-statuses/).
