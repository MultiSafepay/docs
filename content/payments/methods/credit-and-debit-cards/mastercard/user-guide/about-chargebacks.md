Cardholders who disagree with or do not recognise a transaction charged to their credit card can ask Mastercard to raise a dispute. Mastercard then notifies MultiSafepay and reclaims the transaction amount from the merchant.

Mastercard gives cardholders the right to claim chargebacks for up to 180 days after the purchase.

For more information, see [Chargebacks](/faq/chargebacks).

To help reduce chargebacks, see [Displaying your logo in online banking](/payment-methods/credit-and-debit-cards/mastercard/user-guide/displaying-your-logo-in-online-banking).
