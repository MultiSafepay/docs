[Paysafecard](https://www.paysafecard.com/en/) lets customers make online payments using secure prepaid vouchers, available for purchase locally. 

The customer chooses a fixed voucher amount: 10, 25, 50 or 100 EUR. The funds are available immediately.

Customers enter the voucher code, without providing any personal payment details. Vouchers for different amounts are available in the local currency in 46 countries.

The card balance remains available for 12 months free of charge. After 12 months, customers are charged a monthly administration fee of 3 EUR, which is deducted from the balance.
