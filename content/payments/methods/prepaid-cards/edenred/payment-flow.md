## How it works

{{< mermaid class="text-center" >}}

sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Customer
    participant Mu as MultiSafepay
    participant E as Edenred
    participant Me as Merchant

    C->>Mu: Selects Edenred at checkout
    Mu->>C: Connects to Edenred (redirect only)
    C->>E: Authenticates account, authorizes MultiSafepay access
    E->>Mu: Confirms authorization and sufficient funds on voucher
    E->>Me: Settles funds

{{< /mermaid >}}
&nbsp;  

{{< details title="Redirect flow">}}

The customer is redirected first to a [MultiSafepay payment page](/payment-pages/) to select the relevant voucher, and then to their Edenred account. 

See API reference â€“ [Edenred](/api/#edenred).

## Payment statuses

{{< details title="Order and transaction statuses" >}}
For each payment in your MultiSafepay account, there are two statuses that change as payment progresses:

**Order status**  
The progression of the customer's order with you, independent of the payment

**Transaction status**  
The progression towards settling the funds in your MultiSafepay balance

For more information, see [About MultiSafepay statuses](/payments/multisafepay-statuses/).
