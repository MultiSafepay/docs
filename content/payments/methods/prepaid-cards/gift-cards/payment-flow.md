{{< details title="Redirect flow">}}

The customer is redirected to a [MultiSafepay payment page](/payment-pages/) to enter the gift card details. 

See API reference â€“ [Gift cards](/api/#gift-cards).

## Payment statuses

{{< details title="Order and transaction statuses" >}}
For each payment in your MultiSafepay account, there are two statuses that change as payment progresses:

**Order status**  
The progression of the customer's order with you, independent of the payment

**Transaction status**  
The progression towards settling the funds in your MultiSafepay balance

For more information, see [About MultiSafepay statuses](/payments/multisafepay-statuses/).
