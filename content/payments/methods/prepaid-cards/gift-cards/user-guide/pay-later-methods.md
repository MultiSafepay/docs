[Pay later methods](/payments/methods/pay-later/) don't allow customers to enter gift card details **after** placing their order (full or partial payment). This is because, as the collecting party, they require very precise order specifications. 

Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount (not included in the shopping cart specification) and wouldn't generate the correct order information, e.g. for tax purposes. 

Customers can enter gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. You are solely responsible for enabling this. Failure to do so can produce unexpected errors and complications.
