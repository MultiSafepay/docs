MultiSafepay can develop a custom gift card for you. 

**1.** Email an application to your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com> 

**2.** MultiSafepay performs checks and requests information:

- We check the product rules for the relevant payment method. 
- We assess the feasibility of and timeframe for developing the custom gift card.
- We request from you:

    - Whether you want a [closed-loop or open-loop](/payments/methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards/user-guide/about-open-closed-loop/) card
    - The name you want to call your gift card
    - A high-resolution visual mockup of the gift card, preferably in .png or .jpg format, showing the logo as **large** as possible
    - A test gift card with credit and a secure code
    - A startup fee of 200 EUR

**3.** MultiSafepay activates the custom card in your MultiSafepay account.

**4.** To integrate your gift card:

- Using our API, see API reference â€“ [Gift cards](/api/#gift-card).

- In your custom integration, use our [generic gateway code](/faq/general/generic-gateways/). For assistance, ask your developer.

For support, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
