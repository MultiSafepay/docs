- We assess the feasibility of and timeframe for developing the custom gift card.
- We request from you:

    - Whether you want a [closed-loop or open-loop](/payments/methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards/user-guide/about-open-closed-loop/) card
    - The name you want to call your gift card
    - A high-resolution visual mockup of the gift card, preferably in .png or .jpg format, showing the logo as **large** as possible
    - A test gift card with credit and a secure code
    - A startup fee of 200 EUR

**3.** MultiSafepay activates the custom card for your MultiSafepay account.
