## Integration

| | |
|---|---|
| **API** | [Create order](https://api-docs.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder) > Prepaid card order > Examples > Gift card redirect |
| **Ready-made integrations** | We don’t support all open-loop gift cards in our [ready-made integrations](/integrations/ready-made/) and no closed-loop gift cards. Therefore in some integrations, we use [generic gateways](/developer/general/generic-gateways/). {{< br >}} To check if a specific gift card is supported in your ready-made integration, email the Integration Team at integration@multisafepay.com   |
| **Checkout options** | [Multisafepay payment pages](/payment-pages/) {{< br >}} [Payment links](/payment-links/about/) – You can adjust the lifetime. |

## Testing 

See [Test payment details](/testing/test-payment-details/#prepaid-cards).
