{{< blue-notice >}} If using a ready-made integration:

- First check that the gift card is supported.
- Once we have activated the card in your MultiSafepay account, you must also enable it in your [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend). {{< /blue-notice >}}

1. To check your eligibility, email <sales@multisafepay.com> 
2. Send a request to the **card issuer**, providing your company details and MultiSafepay account ID.
3. The issuer connects you to the card using one of the following:

    - [Intersolve](https://intersolve.nl/contact) (majority of gift cards)
    - [Fashioncheque](https://www.fashioncheque.com/nl/customerservice)
    - [123TCS](https://www.123tcs.com/#Contact)

4.  The issuer sends us the connection details and we activate the card in your account.
