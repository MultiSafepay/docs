Gift cards are pre-loaded with a specific amount of credit that customers can use to make online or POS payments. Customers can use gift cards to pay for a transaction in full or in part, and make up the rest with another payment method. 

Gift cards can be open-loop (redeemable at multiple merchants) or closed-loop (redeemable at one specific merchant). For more information, see [About open-loop and closed-loop gift cards](/payment-methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards/user-guide/about-open-closed-loop/).

In addition to accepting established gift card issuers, you can also [create your own custom gift card](/payment-methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards/user-guide/creating-custom-gift-cards/).

- For [open-loop gift cards](/payment-methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards/user-guide/open-closed-loop/):

{{< details title="Post-payment methods" >}}
&nbsp;  
Post-payment methods do not generally support entering gift card details for partial payments or **after** the order is placed (for a whole or partial payment). This is because, as the collecting party, post-payment methods require very precise order specifications. 

Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount (not included in the shopping cart specification) and wouldn't generate the correct order information, e.g. for tax purposes. 

Customers can enter gift card details **before** placing the order, i.e. on your checkout page, before the API request. You are solely responsible for enabling this feature. Failure to follow this rule so can produce unexpected errors and complications.
