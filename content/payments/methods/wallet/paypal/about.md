{{< details title="PayPal Seller Protection" >}}

PayPal Seller Protection covers you in the event of claims, chargebacks, or reversals due to unauthorized purchases or items the customer didn't receive. You are covered for the full amount of all eligible transactions.

To be eligible, for specific countries, transaction requests must contain the correct `state` in the `customer_address`. For a list of the countries, see PayPal API – [State codes](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/nvp-soap-api/state-codes).
