[Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) is a leading global payment method that lets customers tokenize their payment details in a digital wallet. It supports Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa, and Dutch bank accounts. Customers can make both online and near-field communication (NFC) payments. 

An additional layer of security is provided by 3D Secure, which requires customers to verify their identity.

{{< details title="Known errors" >}}

For most of our ready-made integrations, if the customer uses an incompatible device, Apple Pay doesn't appear on the checkout page. 

For our [OpenCart plugin](/opencart/), Apple Pay does appear on the checkout page on incompatible devices, but throws an error when clicked and the payment button is disabled.
