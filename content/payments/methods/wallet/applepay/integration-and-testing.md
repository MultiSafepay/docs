When integrating Apple Pay into your website, you must follow Apple's [branding guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/marketing).

For the Apple Pay logo, see MultiSafepay GitHub – [MultiSafepay icons](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/MultiSafepay-icons).

## Testing

{{< details title="Supported devices" >}}

For supported devices, see Apple – [Apple is compatible with these devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208531).

If you don't own an Apple device, we recommend using the [Appetize.io](https://appetize.io) emulator. When you try to complete a test payment on the MultiSafepay payment page, you get a "This device is not supported" error. But the emulator creates a pretransaction with Apple Pay as a gateway to check if there is an existing connection to our server. However, you can't fully complete the test transaction.

{{< details title="Requirements" >}}

- Use a [compatible device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208531).
- Use Safari browser.
- The website uses HTTPS.
- Maestro must be activated in your MultiSafepay account.

If any of these requirements is not met, Apple Pay doesn't appear on the checkout page.

To test Apple Pay transactions, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Apple Pay** button.  
    You can ignore the "This device is not supported" error.
2. Complete a payment using [test card data](/getting-started/test-your-integration/test-payment-details/#credit-and-debit-cards).
3. The transaction is completed.

### Test environment

We recommend using an Apple Pay – [Sandbox account](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/sandbox-testing).
