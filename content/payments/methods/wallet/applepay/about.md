Apple Pay is a leading global payment method that lets customers tokenize their payment details in a digital wallet. It supports Maestro, Mastercard, Visa, and Dutch bank accounts. Customers can make both online and near-field communication (NFC) payments. An additional layer of security is provided by [3D Secure](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-3d-secure/), which requires customers to verify their identity.

## Product rules

- You can [adjust payment link lifetimes](/api/#adjust-payment-link-lifetimes).  

- Customers must use the Safari browser.  

- For most MultiSafepay plugins, if the customer uses an incompatible device, Apple Pay doesn't appear on the checkout page.  
    For our [OpenCart plugin](/payments/integrations/ecommerce-platforms/opencart/), Apple Pay does appear on the checkout page on incompatible devices, but throws an error when clicked and the payment button is disabled.   

- Apple Pay transactions are processed as credit card transactions and follow similar product rules, with the following exceptions:
    - An SSL secured connection (HTTPS) is required.
    - American Express is **not** supported.

{{< details title="Refunds" >}}

- You cannot refund more than original amount.

- The maximum refund period for Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa transactions is 180 days. After this, we recommend processing refunds by bank transfer.

- While the transaction status is **Initialized**, you can cancel the refund. Once the status changes to **Completed**, the refund has been processed. 

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- The customer receives the refund in their Apple Pay account and it appears on their credit card statement within the next business day.

- If a refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
