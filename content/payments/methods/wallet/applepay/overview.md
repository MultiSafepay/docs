[Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) is a leading global payment method that lets customers tokenize their payment details in a digital wallet. It supports Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa, and Dutch bank accounts. 

Customers can make both online and near-field communication (NFC) payments. 

An additional layer of security is provided by 3D Secure, which requires customers to verify their identity.
