When integrating Google Pay into your website, you must follow [Google's brand guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/brand-guidelines).

## Testing

To test Google Pay payments, follow these steps:

1. In your checkout, click the **Google Pay** button.  
2. {{< details title="Complete the payment" >}}

Complete the payment using your Google account. Your real card details are never processed in our testing environment, but you must add at least one chargeable card to your Google account.

Depending on your card's authentication method, you may or may not be redirected to authenticate:

- **PAN only**: This authentication method is associated with payment cards stored on file in your Google Account. Returned payment data includes personal account number (PAN) with the expiration month and the expiration year. You will be redirected to a test 3D Secure page to authenticate the payment.
- **Cryptogram 3DS**: This authentication method is associated with cards stored as Android device tokens. Returned payment data includes a 3-D Secure (3DS) cryptogram generated on the device. You will not be redirected to authenticate the payment.  

For more information about testing, see Google Pay â€“ [Test with sample tokens](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/resources/sample-tokens).
