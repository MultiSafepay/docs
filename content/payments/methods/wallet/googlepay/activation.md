If you already have credit cards enabled as a payment method in your MultiSafepay account, to activate Apple Pay email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

If you **don't** already have credit cards enabled, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Enable credit card payment methods in your MultiSafepay account. 

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/). 
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payment methods**.
3. Under **Standard payment methods**, select the **Maestro**, **Mastercard**, **Visa**, and **Apple Pay** checkboxes.
4. Click **Save changes**.

**Step 2:** Email your application to enable credit cards **and** Apply Pay as payment methods to the Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com> 

**Step 3:** Provide the following information:

- Maximum, average, and minimum transaction amount
- Annual turnover in credit cards transactions

Once approved by the Risk Team, we activate Visa, Mastercard, Maestro and Apple Pay in your MultiSafepay account.

**Step 4:** Activate Apple Pay in your [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend) to finalize the connection.
