To use Google Pay, you must also have credit card payments activated in your MultiSafepay account. If not already activated, email an application to your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

In the email, provide your expected:

- Average, minimum, and maximum credit card transaction amount
- Annual turnover in credit card transactions

Once approved, to activate credit card payments and Google Pay in your MultiSafepay account, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payment methods**.
3. Under **Additional payment methods**, select the **Google Pay** checkbox and the checkboxes for the credit cards you want to offer.
4. Click **Save changes**.

To process Google Pay direct payments, you need a Google Business account. For more information, see [Google Pay direct integration](/payments/methods/wallet/googlepay/direct-integration/).
