{{< details title="Refunds" >}}

- Full, partial, and API refunds are supported. See [Refunds](/payments/refunds/).

- You can request in3 to process a full or partial refund, either before payout or up to 1&nbsp;year afterwards.

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- Refunds can only be processed for payments linked to transactions. If no payment is linked to the transaction, the customer receives credit on their invoice instead.

- While the transaction status is **Initialized**, you can cancel the refund. Once the status changes to **Completed**, the refund has been processed. 

- The customer receives the refund in the bank account they originally paid from within the next business day.

- If a refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
