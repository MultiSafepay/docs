{{< details title="Refunds" >}}
- You cannot refund more than the amount of the original transaction.

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- Refunds can only be processed for payments linked to transactions. If no payment is linked to the transaction, the customer receives credit on their invoice instead.

- The transaction status changes to **Initialized**. The initialized refund is passed to Santander for processing. At this stage, you can cancel the refund.  

- When the transaction status changes to **Completed**, the refund has been processed correctly. 

- The customer receives the refund in the bank account they originally paid from within the next business day.

- The amount is deducted from the transaction. The refund remains linked to the original transaction.

{{< details title="Gift cards" >}}
&nbsp;  
Post-payment methods do not generally support entering [gift card](/payments/methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards) details **after** the order is placed (for a whole or partial payment). This is because, as the collecting party, Betaal per Maand requires very precise order specifications. 

Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount (not included in the shopping cart specification) and wouldn't generate the correct order information, e.g. for tax purposes. 

Customers can enter gift card details **before** placing the order, i.e. on your checkout page, before the API request. You are solely responsible for enabling this feature. Failure to follow this rule so can produce unexpected errors and complications.
