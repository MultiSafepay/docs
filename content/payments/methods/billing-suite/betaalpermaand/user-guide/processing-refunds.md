{{< details title="Betaal per Maand refund rules" >}}
- You cannot refund more than the amount of the original transaction.

- There is no time limit on refunding successful transactions, so long as the receiving bank can process the refund.

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- Refunds can only be processed for payments linked to transactions. If no payment is linked to the transaction, the customer receives credit on their invoice instead.

- The transaction status changes to **Initialized**. The initialized refund is passed to Santander for processing. At this stage, you can cancel the refund.  

- When the transaction status changes to **Completed**, the refund has been processed correctly. 

- The customer receives the refund in the bank account they originally paid from within the next business day.

- The amount is deducted from the transaction. The refund remains linked to the original transaction.

If a refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
