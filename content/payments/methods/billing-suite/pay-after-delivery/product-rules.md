{{< details title="Refunds" >}}

- Full, partial, and API refunds and discounts are supported. See [Refunds](/payments/refunds/).

- You cannot refund more than the amount of the original transaction.

- You can't process refunds after the invoice is transfered to a collection agency (usually 6 weeks after shipping the order). **Shipped** status is not visible in your MultiSafepay account. To check the date of shipment, email <support@multifactor.nl>

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- Refunds can only be processed for payments linked to transactions. If no payment is linked to the transaction, the customer receives credit on their invoice instead.

- You can't see whether the customer has paid the invoice. If they have already paid, they receive a refund. If not, they receive an adjusted payment request or the invoice is cancelled.

- The customer receives the refund in the bank account they originally paid from within the next business day.

- For both full and partial refunds, any additional administration costs for the customer are deducted from the invoice. The customer has a further 14 days to complete the payment. 

-  You cannot reverse full refunds.

- If a refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multifactor.nl>

{{< details title="Gift cards" >}}
&nbsp;  
Post-payment methods do not generally support entering [gift card](/payments/methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards) details **after** the order is placed (for a whole or partial payment). This is because, as the collecting party, Pay After Delivery requires very precise order specifications.

{{< details title="Multiple order rules" >}}
&nbsp;  
If you supply multiple order rules with the same `merchant-item-id`and the customer requests a partial refund, this creates a conflict. 

To successfully process partial refunds for the same product with different specifications (e.g. size, color) via the shopping cart, each `merchant-item-id` must be unique.

**Example:** For different-sized products, differentiate the `merchant-item-id` with `-size`: 1001311-xxl, 1001311-m, 1001311-s.

- Minimum and maximum order amounts apply. For more information, email your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

- The delivery and invoice addresses must be the **same** to prevent fraud. For&nbsp;more information, see MultiFactor â€“ [Shipping policies](https://www.multifactor.nl/voorwaarden/shipping-policies).
