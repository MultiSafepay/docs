Pay After Delivery is MultiSafepay's own online post-payment method that lets customers pay for orders after receiving them, increasing customer confidence and conversion. Customers are only charged for the items they keep from the order. MultiSafepay bears the risk, based on the customer's history, and guarantees settlement.

### Product rules

{{< details title="Gift cards" >}}
&nbsp;  
Post-payment methods do not generally support entering [gift card](/payment-methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards) details **after** the order is placed (for a whole or partial payment). This is because, as the collecting party, Pay After Delivery requires very precise order specifications. 

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Multiple order rules" >}}
&nbsp;  
If you supply multiple order rules with the same `merchant-item-id`and the customer requests a partial refund, this creates a conflict. 

To successfully process partial refunds for the same product with different specifications (e.g. size, color) via the shopping cart, each `merchant-item-id` must be unique.

**Example:** For different-sized products, differentiate the `merchant-item-id` with `-size`: 1001311-xxl, 1001311-m, 1001311-s.
