Klarna makes your ecommerce platform available in the MultiSafepay partner portal, where your credentials are generated. Use your credentials to configure the Klarna gateway in your MultiSafepay account. 

To integrate Klarna using our API, see API Reference - [Klarna](/api/#klarna).

For questions about your Klarna integration and the connection with your MultiSafepay account, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

For the Klarna logo, see MultiSafepay GitHub – [MultiSafepay icons](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/MultiSafepay-icons).

Test credentials:

- [API key](/tools/multisafepay-control/get-your-api-key/)
- [Klarna's test credentials](https://developers.klarna.com/en/gb/kco-v3/test-credentials)

To test Klarna transactions, follow these steps:

1. Send a [Direct or redirect](/developer/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect/) API request.
2. The payment is processed in the test environment as **Successful**, with order status **Completed**, and transaction status **Uncleared**.
3. To change the order status to **Shipped**, either:
    - Send an [Update an order](/api/#update-an-order) API request, or 
    - Change the status in your MultiSafepay test account.
{{< br >}}The transaction status remains **Uncleared**.
4. No invoice is generated in your test account so you can't change the transaction (financial) status to **Completed**. Alternatively, in your live MultiSafepay account, you can initiate the invoice process by changing the order status to **Shipped**, because the order is captured in Klarna.
