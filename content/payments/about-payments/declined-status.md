This page sets out possible reasons why a credit card payment was declined. 

Only the cardholder can contact the [issuer](/glossaries/credit-cards/#issuer) to find out the specific reason.

#### Declined by MultiSafepay 
Our automated fraud filter flagged the transaction as probably fraudulent.  

Email <support@multisafepay.com> 

#### Do not honor
The issuer declined the transaction. Ask the cardholder to contact them. 

#### 3D Secure authentication cancelled 
Ask the cardholder if they want to try the transaction again. 

#### Expired card
Ask the cardholder for a new card number, and process the payment again. 

**Note:** Make sure you update any recurring payments with the new card details. 

#### Insufficient funds
The card is over the holder's credit limit, or will go over if the transaction is processed.   

- Ask the cardholder to contact the issuer to increase their credit limit, or pay into their account to make more credit available. Once resolved, try again. 
- If not resolved, ask the cardholder for another card number, or use a different payment method.

#### Merchant only accepts 3D Secure-authenticated cards 
Email a request to accept non-3D Secure authenticated cards to <risk@multisafepay.com>
