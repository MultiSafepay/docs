{{< blue-notice >}} Check this page regularly for updates on implementing the PSD2 directive. {{< /blue-notice >}}   

A surcharge is a fee merchants may charge customers on top of the retail price to cover the cost of accepting certain payment methods. Surcharges may be a fixed amount or a percentage of the total order amount.

Your right to apply surcharges varies by payment method and the customerâ€™s country. 

## PSD2

The PSD2 applies to the whole European Economic Area, but individual states can decide how to implement certain aspects. Always check what rules apply in the country your business is registered in. In the Netherlands, the [Authority for Consumers & Markets (ACM)](https://www.acm.nl) is responsible for PSD2 oversight. The Dutch National Bank recommends always contacting ACM for inquiries. 

## Prohibited transactions
For most transactions, merchants are no longer allowed to charge fees for specific payment methods. 

Surcharges are banned for:

* Most credit card transactions when the bank/card issuer and the merchant's PSP are both located within the European Economic Area (EEA)
* Debit card transactions (for both individuals and business customers)
* Standard bank transfers (for both individuals and business customers)
* SEPA Direct Debit (for both individuals and business customers)

## Exempt payment methods
The following payment methods are exempt from the surcharge prohibition:

* For PayPal and pay later methods, merchants can only charge customers for the actual cost the merchant incurs for using the payment method and no more.

* Credit card payments, including American Express and Diners Club, with a card issued outside the EEA, e.g. a tourist with a credit card issued in India

For hybrid card schemes such as American Express and Diners Club, each EU country can decide whether to permit surcharging. Surcharging is permitted under Dutch law.

{{< alert-notice >}} **For Dutch merchants** <br>  We strongly recommend that you do **not** apply surcharges to [pay later methods](/payment-methods/pay-later/). This is now considered providing credit under the Consumer Credit Act (Wet op het consumentenkrediet) and requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). {{< /alert-notice >}}

## Customers outside the EU

The rules for surcharging customers outside the EU remain unchanged. The PSD2 aims to protect European customers.

## Settings changes in your backend and MultiSafepay dashboard

If you are currently surcharging prohibited transactions:

- You do not need to change any settings in your MultiSafepay dashboard.
- You may need to update your settings in your [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend). 

For support, contact the support department of the webshop plugin or your web developer.

If you don't currently apply any surcharges, you don't need to do anything.
