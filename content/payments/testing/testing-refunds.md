You can process full refunds in your [MultiSafepay test account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/). However, partial refunds are not enabled by default. <br>

To enable partial refunds, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

If you refund a payment in your MultiSafepay test account, the [transaction status](/payments/multisafepay-statuses/) remains **Reserved** until the refund is manually approved, since there is no settlement with a bank.
