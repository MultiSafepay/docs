The plugins created by MultiSafepay are tested before release, however, it’s possible that a functionality in your website malfunctions. This can occur due to customized integration, a deviant configuration or a bug.

Our support focuses on problems that are reproducible on a standard website environment. Despite that, we will always try to help you further, even if the problem falls outside our scope.

## Basics 
When beginning an investigation to reproduce an issue, it’s important to always start checking the basics. This way, we all prevent to overlook something. This is done to exclude the possibilities that the issue is occurring in the base.

To benefit the lead time, provide us with available information by answering the following questions:

1. Does the issue occur in the core of the plugin?
2. Does it occur in the core of a payment method?
3. Since when did the issue occur?
4. Has there been an update within a plugin or system recently?
5. Were you able to reproduce the issue yourself?
6. Are examples available?

### Integration Team Rules


* Investigation takes place in a staging or test environment of your ecommerce platform. Therefore, when access is being requested, we will require the credentials of your staging or test ecommerce platform. Create a temporary user-name with password for us to be able to access the staging or test environment.  

   >_For security reasons, we request that you create a strong [password](https://www.lastpass.com/nl/password-generator) when requested._

   >_Always delete an account after finalized work._

* It is advised that you do not provide us with your live account credentials of your ecommerce platform without the consultation or approval from one of our Integration Specialists. In the extraordinary case, we do ask for access to your live environment, it is recommended to make a backup beforehand just in case.

  >_Note: MultiSafepay will not be responsible for mistakes made in a live environment._

1. When server access is required, we exclusively work with SFTP/SSH. Due to security reasons, we no longer support the FTP protocol.

2. When an issue cannot be reproduced in a standard staging or test environment it will be considered as a time-box project.

  A time-box project is when a defined period of time is given during which a task must be accomplished.

  Due to the unknown cause, we are not able to guarantee a solution.
