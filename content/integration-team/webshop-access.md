We test all our ecommerce integrations before release, but your integration may still encounter configuration issues or a bug, especially if it's a [custom integration](/getting-started/glossary/#custom-integration).

We are best able to support issues that are reproducible in a standard website environment. But we always try to offer support, even for issues outside our scope.

## Basics 
When we start trying to reproduce an issue, we always begin with the basics. 

Help us by answering the following questions:

1. Does the issue occur in the plugin core?
2. Does it occur in the payment method core?
3. When did the issue start occuring?
4. Has there been a recent plugin or system update?
5. Can you reproduce the issue?
6. Do you have any examples?

### Integration Team rules

* We conduct our investigations in a staging or test environment of your ecommerce platform. Create a temporary username and a [strong password](https://www.lastpass.com/nl/password-generator) to give us access. Always delete the temporary account after we finish the investigation.

* We only ask for the credentials for your live ecommerce platform account in extraordinary circumstances. In such cases, we recommended making a backup beforehand - just in case.

**Note:** MultiSafepay assumes **no** responsibility for mistakes in your live environment.

- If we require server access, we work exclusively with SFTP and SSH, using Port 22. For security reasons, we no longer support the FTP protocol.

- If we cannot reproduce an issue in a standard staging or test environment, we consider it a _time-box project_. This means we allocate a limited period of time to work on it further. We cannot guarantee a solution.
