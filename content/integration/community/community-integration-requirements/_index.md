At MultiSafepay, our developers write code to process in-house transactions. However, there are also many fantastic developers worldwide who create code wrappers, plugins, and applications in order to integrate our products and services.

We'd like to work with you, and will help market your work and promote it on MultiSafepay Docs. To add your project to MultiSafepay Docs, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

If you want to publish a MultiSafepay community integration, you have to adhere to the following agreements:

* The plugin information should be visible in the JSON format and include how to configure the integration. For more information, see [Create order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder) > Body params > .. > Plugin.
* The readme should indicate that full responsibility lies with the developer of the community integration. This includes customer support and maintenance of the code. It should also be clear that the integration was **not created by MultiSafepay**
* If we decide to add the community integration as one of the supported integrations by MultiSafepay, we will have the authority to also remove the community integration without the breach of contract
* The community integration should be updated to maintain its functionality.

For any questions about joining our developer community, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

**MultiSafepay expects you to provide a high level of service and support to merchants. Possible action may be taken if we receive a high number of complaints.**
