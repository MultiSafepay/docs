{{< alert-notice >}} **Attention Dutch merchants** <br>  We strongly recommend that you do **not** apply surcharges to [pay later methods](/payment-methods/pay-later/). This is now considered providing credit under the Wet op het consumentenkrediet and article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek, and requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). {{< /alert-notice >}}

Applying [surcharges](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-surcharges/) or payment fees is no longer supported in the Magento 2 plugin.

## Using Fooman

To apply a surcharge or payment fee to a payment method, you can use the third-party [Fooman](https://store.fooman.co.nz/extensions/magento2) package.

You can refund orders with a Fooman surcharge applied in your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), but not from your Magento 2 [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend). 

## Support

The Integration Team will do their best to support you with installing Fooman, but bear in mind that it is a third-party package. We can't guarantee perfect compatibility.

## PSD2 implications  

For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-payment-service-directive-2).
