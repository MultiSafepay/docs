{{< alert-notice >}} **Attention Dutch merchants** <br>  We strongly recommend that you do **not** apply surcharges to [pay later methods](/payment-methods/pay-later/). This is now considered providing credit under the Wet op het consumentenkrediet and article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek, and requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). {{< /alert-notice >}}

You can apply [surcharges](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-surcharges/) or payment fees with the WooCommerce plugin when combined with a relevant third-party package. The package must follow WooCommerce and Wordpress development guidelines.

**Support**  
The Integration Team will do their best to help you install third-party packages, but we can't guarantee perfect compatibility.

**PSD2 implications**  
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/payment-regulations/psd2/).
