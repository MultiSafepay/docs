The WooCommerce plugin offers a [generic gateway](/integrations/generic-gateways/) that supports all payment methods. 

You can:

- Filter the generic gateway by country, and minimum and maximum amount.
- Set a custom initial order status.
- Process full and partial refunds (except for pay later methods), and backend orders.

To configure a generic gateway:

1. Sign in to your [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payments** tab > **Generic gateway**.
3. Set the relevant [payment method gateway codes](/integrations/generic-gateways/#gateway-codes), and the gateway logo and label.
4. For pay later methods, include the shopping cart in refunds.
