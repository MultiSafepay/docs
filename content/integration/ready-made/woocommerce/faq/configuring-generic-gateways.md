The WooCommerce plugin supports a [generic gateway](/faq/general/generic-gateways/) for all payment methods. 

To configure the generic gateway, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your WooCommerce [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payments** tab. All payment methods are listed here.
3. Select **Generic gateway** and set:
   * Gateway code
   * Gateway logo
   * Gateway label
   * For pay later methods, whether to include the shopping cart in refunds (**required**)

- You can filter the generic gateway by:
  - Country
  - Minimum amount
  - Maximum amount

- You can also set a custom initial order status.

- Full refunds, partial refunds (except for pay later methods), and backend orders are fully supported.
