To generate a payment link in your WooCommerce [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend) once an order is created, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your WooCommerce backend.
2. Go to **WooCommerce** > **Orders** > **Add order**.
3. For instructions to register the order details, see WooCommerce - [Managing orders](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/#section-16).
4. In **Order actions** panel, select the **Email invoice / order details to customer** option.  
5. Click **Create order**.  
  An email is sent to the customer containing the order details and a payment link. The payment link is also available to the customer in their private account, under **Orders**.
