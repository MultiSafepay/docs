## User guide

### Generic gateways

The plugin supports generic gateways, which redirect customers from your checkout to a MultiSafepay [payment page](/payment-pages/). You can use them to integrate custom gift cards, or co-branded credit cards. 

{{< details title="Configuring generic gateways" >}}

1. Sign in to your Shopware 6 backend.
2. Go to **MultiSafepay settings**.
3. Set the relevant [payment method gateway IDs](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/gateway-ids).

Generic gateways support:

- All payment methods (filter by country, and minimum/maximum amount)
- [Split payments](/payments/split-payments/), [Second Chance reminders](/features/second-chance/) and [virtual IBANs](/payments/virtual-ibans/)
- [Redirect requests](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/introduction#direct-vs-redirect) only

**Gift cards**

Generic gateways are particularly useful for integrating [gift cards](/payment-methods/gift-cards/), including [custom gift cards](/payment-methods/gift-cards/custom-cards/). This is because we don't support all [open-loop gift cards](/payment-methods/gift-cards/open-loop-closed-loop/) in our ready-made integrations and *no* closed-loop gift cards.

**Co-branded credit cards**

You can integrate Visa co-branded credit cards ([Cartes Bancaires](/payment-methods/cartes-bancaires/), [Dankort](/payment-methods/dankort/), and [V Pay](/payment-methods/vpay/)), using the generic `VISA` gateway.
