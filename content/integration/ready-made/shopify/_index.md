## Installation

To install or migrate, follow these steps:

1. For increased security and stability, wait for off-peak hours and temporarily enable password protection for your webshop.
2. From the Shopify app store, install the [MultiSafepay Payments app](https://apps.shopify.com/multisafepay-payments).  
3. Enter your [site API key](/account/managing-websites/#viewing-the-site-id-api-key-and-secure-code), and specify whether it is live or test.
4. Click **Save and continue** (this might take a few seconds).
  A pop up or new tab opens.
5. Scroll down and click **Activate MultiSafepay payments**. 
6. Under **Admin** > **Settings** > **Payments** > **Alternative payment methods**, check that the app has been successfully added. 
7. In your Shopify checkout, test the **MultiSafepay payments** gateway.  
  **Note:** If using a test API key, make sure you also enable **Test mode**. 
8. For existing merchants, under **Admin** > **Settings** > **Payments** > **Third-party payment providers**, disable the deprecated individual MultiSafepay payment method gateways.
9. Once testing is complete, disable password protection again.

## User guide

### Abandoned checkouts

MultiSafepay's [Second Chance](/features/second-chance/) feature is **not** supported because Shopify offers a similar native service.

See Shopify â€“ [Recovering abandoned checkouts](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/abandoned-checkouts).

### Cancelling payments

If a customer cancels a payment to use another payment method instead, they must complete payment within **2 hours** to avoid errors.

### Countries

The app is unavailable in Norway and Finland. 

For more information, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

### Currencies

Payments are processed in the webshop's default currency only.

### Deprecated version
