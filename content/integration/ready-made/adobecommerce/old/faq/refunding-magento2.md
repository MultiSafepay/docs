You can refund orders or issue credit memos from your Magento 2 [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).  

1. Sign in to your Magento backend.
2. Go to the **Invoices** tab, and click the relevant MultiSafepay invoice.
3. Click **Credit memo**, and then click either:  
    - Offline refund: No refund request is sent to MultiSafepay.
    - Refund: A refund request is sent to MultiSafepay.

You can also refund from your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).

**Note:** For orders with a Fooman surcharge, you cannot refund from your backend but you can from your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
