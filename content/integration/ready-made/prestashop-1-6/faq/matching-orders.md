In Prestashop 1.6, the order ID is generated after the payment, which causes a mismatch with the order ID in your MultiSafepay account. 

You can match orders using the transaction ID. 

To view a payment's transaction ID:

1. Sign in to your Prestashop 1.6 [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Payment** > **Order details**.
