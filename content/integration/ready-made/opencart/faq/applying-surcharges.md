Applying [surcharges](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-surcharges/) or payment fees is no longer supported, but you can request a patch. Email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com> 

**PSD2 implications**
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-payment-service-directive-2).   

{{< alert-notice >}} **For Dutch merchants** <br>  We strongly recommend that you do **not** apply surcharges to [pay later methods](/payment-methods/pay-later/). This is now considered providing credit under the Consumer Credit Act (Wet op het consumentenkrediet) and requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). {{< /alert-notice >}}
