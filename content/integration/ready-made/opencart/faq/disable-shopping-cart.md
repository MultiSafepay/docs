If you notice errors in shopping cart calculations, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

As a temporary solution, you can disable sending the shopping cart with the payment request.

{{< alert-notice >}} **Note:** Pay later methods do not work if the shopping cart is disabled. {{< /alert-notice >}}

1. Sign in to your OpenCart [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Extensions** > **Payments** > **MultiSafepay**.
3. In the MultiSafepay extension, go to the **Options** tab.
4. Set the **Disable Shopping Cart** toggle to **Yes**.
5. Click **Save**.
