**Disabling payment methods**
You can disable payment methods in the **Payment method settings list**. Enabled payment methods show a green dot, when disabled its grey.

To disable payment methods for specific languages, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Lightspeed app.
2. Select the relevant storefont.
4. For each language, disable the relevant payment methods. 

If no specific language rule-set is found, **Default** is used.

**Missing payment methods**

By default, newly activated payment methods for your MultiSafepay account are disabled in the Lightspeed app's MultiSafepay payments settings. You need to enable them in both environments.

If a payment method is missing:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) and check that the payment method is enabled.
2. Sign in to your Lightspeed app, go to **Settings**, and then enable the payment method again.
