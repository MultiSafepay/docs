## Upgrading to the new app

To upgrade from our deprecated [core integration](/payments/integrations/ecommerce-platforms/lightspeed_core) to the Lightspeed app, follow these steps:

1. In the [Lightspeed app manual](/lightspeed/#installation), follow the steps to install the Lightspeed app.

2. Place a test order to make sure it's working properly.

3. Open the [classic MultiSafepay payment gateway settings](https://services.webshopapp.com/login/?redirect=/payment_providers/859452), and then disable the payment provider.

To access the MultiSafepay Payments app **Settings** page:

- You are automatically redirected after installing the app, or 
- Select the MultiSafepay Payments app, and then click **Go to app**.

## Disabling the core integration

To disable the core integration after migrating to the new app, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Lightspeed [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payment providers** > **MultiSafepay**.
2. At the top of the screen, click **Disable this payment provider**.

For any questions about the app, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

## Returning to the core integration

To switch back to the core integration, uninstall the app from the app store and re-enable the core integration.
