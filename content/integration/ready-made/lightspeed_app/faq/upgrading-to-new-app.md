## Upgrading to the new app

To upgrade from our deprecated core integration to the Lightspeed app, follow these steps:

1. In the [Lightspeed app manual](/lightspeed/#installation), follow the steps to install the app.
2. Place a test order to make sure it's working properly.
3. Open the core integration, and then [disable the payment provider](/lightspeed-app/upgrading/#disabling-the-core-integration).

To access the MultiSafepay Payments app **Settings** page:

- You are automatically redirected after installing the app, or 
- Select the MultiSafepay Payments app, and then click **Go to app**.

## Disabling the core integration

To disable the core integration after migrating to the new app, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Lightspeed [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payment providers** > **MultiSafepay**.
2. At the top of the screen, click **Disable this payment provider**.

For any questions about the app, email <integration@multisafepay.com>
