To set a maximum/minimum order amount for a payment method to display on your checkout page, follow these steps:

1. In the **Payment methods ordering** list, click the **+** button to open the relevant payment method.
2. Enter an amount in EUR cents in the:  
    - **Maximum** field. E.g. A maximum value of 1500 cents means the payment method only appears on the checkout page if the total order amount is **less** then 15 EUR. If you **don't** want a maximum amount, enter **-1**.
    **OR**
    - **Minimum** field. E.g. A minimum value of 1500 cents means the payment method only appears on the checkout page if the total order amount is **more** then 15 EUR.

**Setting a maximum/minimum order amount per language**

To set different maximum/minimum order amounts for different languages, under the **Payment methods ordering** header > **Country** list, select a country and set the maximum/minimum amount per language.

If no specific rule is set for a language, **Default** language is used.
