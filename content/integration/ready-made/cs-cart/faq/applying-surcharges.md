You can apply surcharges when configuring the payment method under **Surcharge**. Always enter the amount **including** VAT.

{{< alert-notice >}} **Attention Dutch merchants** <br>  We strongly recommend that you do **not** apply surcharges to [pay later methods](/payment-methods/pay-later/). This is now considered providing credit under the Wet op het consumentenkrediet and article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek, and requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). {{< /alert-notice >}}
