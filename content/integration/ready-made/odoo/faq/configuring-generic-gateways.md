The Odoo plugin offers a [generic gateway](/developer/generic-gateways/) that supports all payment methods. 

You can:

- Filter the generic gateway by country, and minimum and maximum amount
- Refund completed orders only

To configure the generic gateway:

1. Sign in to your [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend). 
2. Go to **Invoicing** > **Payment method** > **Other payment acquirer** > **MultiSafepay**.
3. In the **Title** field, set the relevant [payment method gateway codes](/integrations/gateway-codes). 
4. Set the gateway logo and name.
