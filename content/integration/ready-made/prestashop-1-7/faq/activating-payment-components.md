The MultiSafepay PrestaShop 1.7 plugin supports [Payment Components](/payment-components/), which:

- Provide a seamless checkout experience to increase [conversion](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#conversion-rate).
- Encrypt customer payment details for secure processing.
- Shift responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) to MultiSafepay.

If you're new to accepting credit card payments, email a request to activate them to <sales@multisafepay.com>
