The PrestaShop 1.7 plugin offers a [generic gateway](/faq/general/generic-gateways/) that supports all payment methods. You can filter the gateway by:

- Country
- Currency
- Customer group
- Minimum and maximum amount

To configure the generic gateway:

1. Sign in to your [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Improve** > **MultiSafepay** > **Payment methods** > **Generic gateway**.
3. Set the relevant [payment method gateway codes](/integrations/gateway-codes) and the gateway icon.
