**Refunds**

- From your [MultiSafepay dashboard](/refunds/full-partial/): Full and partial refunds for all payment methods 
- From your PrestaShop 1.7 [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend):  
    - Full and partial refunds
    - [Pay later refunds](/payment-methods/pay-later/) **not** supported
    
When doing a refund through the PrestaShop [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend) it will automatically process this refund through the MultiSafepay API. If you choose to use a voucher refund, it will not process this refund through the MultiSafepay API.
