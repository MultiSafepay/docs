{{< alert-notice >}} **Attention Dutch merchants** <br>  We strongly recommend that you do **not** apply surcharges to [pay later methods](/payment-methods/pay-later/). This is now considered providing credit under the Wet op het consumentenkrediet and article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek, and requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). {{< /alert-notice >}}

Applying [surcharges](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-surcharges/) or payment fees is not automatically supported in our PrestaShop 1.7 plugin.

**Support**  
There are several [third-party addons](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/search?search_query=surcharge) available for surcharges. However, we can't guarantee compatibility with our plugin. Make sure that you test these addons carefully before installing.

**PSD2 implications**  
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-payment-service-directive-2).
