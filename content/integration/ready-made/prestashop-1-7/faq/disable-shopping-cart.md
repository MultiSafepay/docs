If you notice errors in shopping cart calculations, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

 As a temporary solution, you can disable sending the shopping cart with the payment request.

{{< alert-notice >}} **Note:** Pay later methods do not work if the shopping cart is disabled. {{< /alert-notice >}}

1. Sign in to your PrestaShop 1.7 [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Improve** > **Module manager** > **MultiSafepay**.
3. In the MultiSafepay module, go to the **General settings** tab.
4. Set the **Disable Shopping Cart** toggle to **Enabled**.
5. Click **Save**.
