The plugin supports [generic gateways](/faq/general/generic-gateways/), e.g. for branded gateways. They work much like other redirect payment methods. All features are supported, except for recurring payments.

1. Sign in to your Shopware 5 [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).
2. Go to the **MultiSafepay settings** page.
3. Enter the gateway code provided by MultiSafepay.
4. Upload a custom gateway image, if relevant.
5. Specify if the gateway requires a shopping cart or not.

For any questions about integrating generic gateways, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
