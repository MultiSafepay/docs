The Craft Commerce 3 plugin offers [generic gateways](/integrations/generic-gateways/) and generic gift cards, which support all payment methods.

To configure a generic gateway:

1. Sign in to your backend. 
2. Go to *** (Dennis to check).
3. Set the relevant [payment method gateway codes](/integrations/generic-gateways/#gateway-codes) and the gateway label.
