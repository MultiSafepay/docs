There are 3 ways to update the plugin:

- In your [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend)
- In the CMS marketplace 
- Using SFTP

To update the plugin in your backend, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a backup of your production environment, and that you test the plugin in a staging environment.
2. From the [X-Cart manual](/payments/integrations/ecommerce-platforms/x-cart), download the plugin again.
3. Follow the Installation and configuration instructions from step 1.
