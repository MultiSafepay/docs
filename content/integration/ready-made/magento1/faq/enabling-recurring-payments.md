To enable recurring payments:

1. Sign in to your Magento 1 [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend).
2. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **MultiSafepay** > **MultiSafepay settings**.

For more information, see [Recurring Payments](/features/recurring-payments).

**Credit cards**
Recurring Payments are not available for the generic credit card gateway. You must enable the Visa, Mastercard, and/or Maestro gateways separately. This displays the **Save card** option at checkout.
