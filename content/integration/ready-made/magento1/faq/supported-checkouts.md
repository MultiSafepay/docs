Our plugin is compatible with most Magento 1 checkouts. However, we cannot guarantee that all checkout features will function properly.

We test our plugin with:  

- Magento 1 core checkout  
- OneStepCheckout.com (Idev)  

{{< blue-notice>}}**Note:** Always test OneStepCheckout before use to make sure it is compatible with your specific configuration of the plugin. {{< /blue-notice>}}
