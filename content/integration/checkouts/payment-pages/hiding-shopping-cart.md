If you include a `shopping_cart` object in your `POST /orders` request, the cart details are displayed on the [payment page](/payment-pages/) by default. That is, all items in the customer's order, with the price and VAT for each. 

To hide shopping cart details on payment pages:

**1.** To request to enable **Advanced website templates** for your MultiSafepay account, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

**2.** Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/). 

**3.** Go to **Settings** > **New payment pages**.

**4.** Next to the relevant website, click **Template**.

**5.** Under **Configure page style**, click **Settings**, and then select the **Hide cart details** checkbox. 

For support, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
