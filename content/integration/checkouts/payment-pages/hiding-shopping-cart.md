If you include a `shopping_cart` object in your [create order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder) request, the cart details are displayed on the [payment page](/payment-pages/) by default. That is, all items in the customer's order, with the price and VAT for each. 

To hide shopping cart details on payment pages:

1. To request to enable **Advanced website templates** for your MultiSafepay account, email <integration@multisafepay.com>
2. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/). 
3. Go to **Settings** > **New payment pages**.
4. Next to the relevant website, click **Template**.
5. Under **Configure page style**, click **Settings**, and then select the **Hide cart details** checkbox.
