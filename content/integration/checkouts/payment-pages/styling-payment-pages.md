We recommend styling MultiSafepay payment pages to be consistent with the look and feel of your website.

You can do this via your MultiSafepay dashboard, or our API. 

## Dashboard

To style payment page templates from your MultiSafepay dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Website settings** > **Website**.
3. Click the **Template** button. 
4. Use the WYSIWYG editor to style the payment page template.  
    - Choosing colors: In the left menu, a color chart appears when you click on the field of a page element. You can also enter a [Hex color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) in the input field next to it.
    - Selecting a logo or header image: In **Settings** > **Payment page templates**, upload files for logos or header backgrounds. They may take up to 5 minutes to process, and then automatically appear in the dropdown list in the editor.
5. To save the finished template to the relevant website, click **Submit website**.

- If you have more than one template and want to set one as your default template, use the **Set default** option. You can also give this template a name, which is used as the `template_id`. 

- To edit saved templates, click the **Edit template** button in the top-left corner.

- To apply the style from one template to another website under your account, click the **Apply style from** button in the top-right corner. Save the template to the relevant website.
