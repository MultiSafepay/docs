The deprecated version of the MultiSafepay payment page (URL: `pay.multisafepay.com`) is still fully supported, but we strongly recommend [upgrading to the current version](/payment-pages/activation/), which: 

- Processes requests to and responses from the MultiSafepay server much faster

- Works responsively across different devices and browsers 

- Supports [dynamic styling through our API](/api/#apply-dynamic-templates)

- Supports 5 more languages 

- Supports all available payment methods

### Payment methods
We cannot guarantee the deprecated version will support any new payment methods we add to our platform.

It does **not** support the following payment methods:

| Category   | Payment methods     |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Banking methods | Bancontact QR, Belfius, CBC/KBC, EPS, iDEALQR, Request to Pay, Santander, Sofort, Trustly     |
| Pay later methods | AfterPay, in3, Klarna     |
| Wallets | Alipay, Apple Pay, JCB    |
| Prepaid cards | PaySafecard   |
