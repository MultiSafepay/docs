The deprecated version of the payment page (URL: `pay.multisafepay.com`) is still fully supported, but we strongly recommend [upgrading to the current version](/payment-pages/activation/), which: 

- Processes requests to and responses from the MultiSafepay server much faster
- Works responsively across different devices and browsers 
- Supports:
    - [Dynamic styling through our API](/api/#apply-dynamic-templates)
    - 5 more languages 
    - All available payment methods

### Payment methods
We cannot guarantee that the deprecated version will support any new payment methods we add to our platform.

It does **not** support the following methods:

- Banking methods: Bancontact QR, Belfius, CBC/KBC, EPS, iDEALQR, Request to Pay, Santander, Sofort, Trustly
- Pay later methods: AfterPay, in3, Klarna
- Wallets: Alipay, Apple Pay
- Prepaid cards: PaySafecard
