## Step 2: Initialize the component

### Generate an API token
FastCheckout requires a MultiSafepay API token. See API reference&nbsp;–&nbsp;[Generate an API token](/api/#generating-api-tokens).

{{< alert-notice >}} **Note:** To keep your API key private, request the token from your own server. {{< /alert-notice >}} 

### Construct the component object

**1.** Initialize an `orderData` object, containing information about the customer's order collected during the checkout process:

```
xxx
```

{{< details title="View properties" >}}

| Key | Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| currency| The currency of the order. Format: [ISO-4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), e.g. `EUR`. **Required**. |
| amount| The value of the order. Format: Number without decimal points, e.g. 100 euro is formatted as `10000`. **Required**. |
| customer.country| The customer's country code. Checks the availability of the payment method. Format: [ISO-3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), e.g. `NL`. **Optional**. |
|customer.locale | The customer's language. Sets the language of the Payment Component UI. Format: [ISO-3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), e.g. `NL`. Supported languages: `EN`, `ES`, `FR`, `IT`, `NL`. **Optional**.|
| customer.reference| Your unique customer reference. **Required for recurring payments**. |
| recurring.model| The [tokenization model](/payments/features/tokenization/). **Required for recurring payments**. |
| template.settings.embed_mode| A template designed to blend in seamlessly with your ecommerce platform. Format:&nbsp;Boolean. **Optional**. |

{{< details title="Processing recurring payments" >}}

[Recurring payments](/payments/features/tokenization/) let you store a customer’s payment details as a secure, encrypted token.

Upon subsequent payments, customers can select their stored payment details and pay with a single click.

To process recurring payments in your Payment Component:

- Add the `cardOnFile` recurring model
- Provide the relevant `customer.reference`

```
xxx
```

Recurring payments are supported for all credit card payments.

**Note**: For test credit card details, see Test payment details – [Credit and debit cards](/testing/test-payment-details/#credit-and-debit-cards).

To use recurring payments in your Payment Component, you need to enable recurring payments for your account. If you haven't already, email your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

{{< /details >}}

**Note:** We use the `orderData` object to ensure the payment method is enabled and the currency, country, and transaction amount are supported. 

**2.** Construct a `PaymentComponent` object in the `test` environment using the `orderData` object and your API token:

```
xxx
```

### Initialize the component

**1.** Call the `PaymentComponent.init()` method with the following arguments:

```
xxx
```
**2.** Replace the `<GATEWAY>` placeholder with the relevant payment gateway code.
{{< details title="View gateway codes" >}}

| Payment method| Gateway code|
|---|---|
| Bank transfer | `BANKTRANS` |
| Bancontact | `MISTERCASH` |
| Credit cards |`CREDITCARD`|
| iDEAL|`IDEAL`|
| PayPal | `PAYPAL` |
| SEPA Direct Debit | `DIRDEB` |
| Sofort | `DIRECTBANK`|

{{< /details >}}

**3.** Create event handlers for the following events:

{{< details title="View events" >}}

| Event | Event handler |
| ---- | ---- |
|`onError`| Called when an error occurs in the Payment Component|
|`onLoad`| Called when the Payment Component UI is rendered |
|`onSelect`| Occurs when the customer selects an issuer with iDEAL. |
|`onSubmit`| Occurs when the customer clicks the payment button (when using the button generated by the component). |
|`onValidation`| Occurs when form validation changes. Can be used to disable the payment button until all fields are validated. |

{{< /details >}}

**Note:** The `PaymentComponent` uses the following methods:

{{< details title="View methods" >}}

| Method | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|`getErrors`| Returns error details, e.g. error messages or codes|
|`hasErrors`| Returns a boolean value depending on whether errors have been registered |
|`getPaymentData`| Returns a `payment_data` object with a `payload` containing the customer's payment details, used to [create orders](/payment-components/single/step-3/), and the `gateway`.|
|`getOrderData`| Returns an object containing a `payment_data` object and the full order configuration. |
