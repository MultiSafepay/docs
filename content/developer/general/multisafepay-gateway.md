Our ready-made integrations support a MultiSafepay payment gateway. This redirects the customer from your webshop checkout to a MultiSafepay payment page displaying all of your activated payment methods. The customer then selects a payment method and completes payment on the payment page. 

To activate the MultiSafepay gateway for all websites in your account:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payment methods**.
3. Under **Standard payment methods**, select the **MultiSafepay** checkbox.
4. Click **Save changes**.
