An inline frame, or iFrame, is an HTML document embedded inside another HTML document on a [website](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#website). 
 
Although MultiSafepay doesn't prohibit iFrames, we don't recommend them. Reasons include:

- Some payment methods may not respond if you use an iFrame for privacy and security reasons.
 
- Some banks use scripts that can't load in iFrames. 

- Google Chrome's safety checks on iFrames are very strict.
