In our plugins, we use predefined gateways for specific payment methods. When we start supporting a new payment method, you need to update your plugin to use the new gateway. 

To avoid this, some of our plugins use generic gateways which include a flexible gateway code that lets them connect to almost every payment method we offer, without updating the plugin.

### Requirements

Generic gateways only support [`redirect`](/developer/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect/) requests.

## Gift cards 

Generic gateways can be particularly useful for gift cards, because we don't support all open-loop gift cards in our ecommerce integrations and no [closed-loop gift cards](/getting-started/glossary/#closed-loop-gift-card). Therefore in some integrations, we use generic gift card gateways.

For more information about integrating open-loop and closed-loop gift cards in our platform, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

## Co-branded credit cards

You can integrate Visa co-branded credit cards, such as [Cartes Bancaires](/payments/methods/cartes-bancaires/) and [Dankort](/payments/methods/dankort/), using the generic `VISA` gateway code.  

For the gateway image, see MultiSafepay GitHub â€“ [MultiSafepay icons](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/MultiSafepay-icons/tree/master/methods).
