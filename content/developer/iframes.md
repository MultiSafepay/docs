An inline frame, or `<iframe>`, is an HTML document embedded inside another HTML document on a site. 
 
Although MultiSafepay doesn't prohibit embedding a payment page as an `<iframe>`, we don't recommend it. This is because:

- Some payment methods may not work if you use an `<iframe>`, for privacy and security reasons. 
- Some banks use scripts that can't run within `<iframe>` elements.
- Modern browsers' can block them due to stricter security checks.

Instead, we recommend using [Payment Components](https://docs.multisafepay.com/payment-components/) to embed payments into your site.
