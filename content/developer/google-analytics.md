Google Analytics is a popular web analytics service used to analyze data collected from your site like site activity and session duration. Google Analytics is a service offered by Google and has had a few versions over the years:

| Version | Javascript library | Google support |
|---|---|---|
| <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs?hl=en" target="_blank">Classic Google Analytics (GA1)</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> | `ga.js` | Deprecated |
| <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs" target="_blank">Universal Analytics (GA2)</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> | `analytics.js` | Until 1st July 2023 |
| <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs" target="_blank">Universal Analytics (GA3)</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> | `gtag.js` | Until 1st July 2023 |
| <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4" target="_blank">Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> | `gtag.js` with a different data model | Supported |

# Universal Analytics
Universal Analytics is an older version of Google Analytics that uses a data model based on sessions and page views. 

# Google Analytics 4
Google Analytics 4 is the most recent version of Google Analytics that uses a data model based on events and parameters.

# Javascript libraries

If you use `analytics.js`, Google gives you a **tracking ID** that needs to be added to each page of your site, e.g. `UA-00000-2`. The tracking ID tells Google Analytics which account and property (site) the collected data belongs to.

If you use `gtag.js`, then you use **tags** instead of tracking IDs. The `gtag.js` library adds a single tag to your site to connect with multiple Google products and services (including Google Analytics). 

> **Note:** All Google Analytics accounts since 2017 use `gtag.js`. Prior to 2017, `analytics.js` was the default method for tagging.

## Ready-made integrations

You can add your tracking ID or tag to the following ready-made integrations, so that if you use our [payment pages](/docs/payment-pages/) we embed it in the HTML of the page to continue data collection:

- Magento 2
- Magento 1
- Odoo
- WooCommerce
- OpenCart
- PrestaShop 1.6
- Shopware 5
- OsCommerce
- X-Cart
- Zen Cart

## Self-made integrations

You can add your tracking ID or tag in your self-made integration by adding it in `google_analytics.account` when you [create an order](/reference/createorder/).

# Errors

Sometimes Google Analytics can miss or incorrectly report part of a customer's journey if your customers are redirected away from your site. This can be because:

- Customers pay but do not return to your site's success page.
- When your customer is redirected to your site's success page, a different browser is opened. Google Analytics considers this a new session. For example, from in-app browser to their default browser, or, from your customer's preferred browser to their default browser.
- When your customer is redirected to your site's success page from a third-party site. Google Analytics considers this a new session from a different source.
- Customers have blocked third-party cookies.

This makes Google Analytics reports unreliable, and they don't accurately capture <<glossary:conversion>> rates. There are some ways to mitigate this.

## Client side solutions

### How to exclude referrals

To prevent third-party shopping carts initiating new sessions, you can exclude referral domains. 

The customer isn't counted as a referral when they return to your success page. 

> **Note:** This feature is only available for sites using `gtag.js` or `analytics.js`.

For instructions, see Google Analytics â€“ <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2795830" target="_blank">Referral exclusions</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.

When you click **+Add referral exclusion**, enter the following:

### utm_nooverride=1 parameter

To tell Google that your customer's initial session is still in progress and to ignore referral information for the "new" session, add the `utm_nooverride=1` parameter to your payment <<glossary:gateway>> success pages. 

For example, for the page URL `/checkout/payment/success`, pass your gateway the following URL: `/checkout/payment/success?utm_nooverride=1`. 

In your PHP code, the parameter should look like this: `$thisâ†’_redirect('checkout/onepage/success', ['utm_nooverride' => '1'])`.

Make sure you do this for all links from the payment gateway to your site.

**Note:** Our ready-made integrations for Magento 1 and 2 do this automatically. 

## Server side solutions

These solutions need a server environment and may require significant development effort.

> **Note:** Server side solutions are still in their infancy and due to ongoing political discussions implementing a server side solution could require regular adjustment and maintenance.

### Measurement protocol
To send additional event data to Google Analytics you can use Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4" target="_blank">measurement protocol</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>. You can use notifications from our [webhook](/docs/configure-your-webhook) to send additional information about a customer's journey to Google Analytics. For example, that payment was successful or that the order was cancelled.

### Google Tag Manager server side tagging

Instead of using client side javascript libraries to collect and send data directly to Google Analytics, you can send data to your server for further processing before forwarding to Google Analytics.

This provides several benefits:
- Moves data processing from client side to server side, which reduces page load time.
- If your server is hosted on a subdomain of your site, you collect customers' data instead of a third party. This avoids conflicts with third party cookies.
- You can add additional event data from other sources like MultiSafepay's [webhook notifications](/docs/configure-your-webhook).

For more information, see Google Tag Manager - <a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/server-side" target="_blank">Server-side tagging</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.

To follow your customers' journeys between different sessions or browsers, you need to also update the data layer of your site to capture information that allows you to accurately identify your customers. For more information, see Google Tag Manager - <a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/web/datalayer" target="_blank">The data layer</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.

> **Note:** It is not possible to use client side and server side solutions at the same time.
