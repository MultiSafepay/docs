| 1021  | Cannot create transaction | With direct payment methods, customers are directed from your website straight to their bank's payment page, instead of to a MultiSafepay payment page. Because the payment doesn't take place on a MultiSafepay page, we cannot filter out errors related to connection issues. This error can cause an increase in unpaid or expired transactions.                                                                                                                                                          | Check whether the customer's bank has a temporary malfunction.   <a name="1022"></a>                                                                                                      |

| 1024  | Transaction refused | This error can occur for Pay After Delivery and credit card transactions if there is incorrect customer data, or if the transaction was refused due to the risk profile.                                                                                       | 1.

If several partial refunds were requested, check that the sum of the partial refunds doesn't exceed the original transaction amount.   <br> 4. Check that you are permitted to make withdrawals from your MultiSafepay account. <br> 5. Check if the same refund was paid within in a short period of time. If a second refund for the same amount is requested within 5 minutes, MultiSafepay rejects the second request to protect against double processing. Refunds sent in a batch via the API will cause this error because the process is so quick. You need to [delay refund requests](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/refund-script) by at least 1 second to avoid the error.                       |
