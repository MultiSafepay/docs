***

### 1020: Account is blocked

For security reasons, we have blocked your MultiSafepay account and it cannot process payments.

Email [sales@multisafepay.com](mailto:sales@multisafepay.com)

***

### 1021: Cannot create transaction

Direct requests don't involve a payment page, which means we can't filter out connection errors. This error can cause an increase in unpaid or expired transactions.

Check whether the customerâ€™s bank is experiencing a temporary malfunction.

***

### 1022: Cannot initiate transaction

The transaction may already exist with a third party.

For example, if an iDEAL transaction already exists and another <Glossary>direct</Glossary> iDEAL transaction is initiated, you receive an `Error 1022: Kan geen transactie starten: ERR_EXISTS: transaction error.`

***

### 1023: Gateway unavailable

The `gateway` is unavailable. This error can occur with <Glossary>direct</Glossary> requests.

* Check whether the payment method supports <Glossary>direct</Glossary> requests.
* Ensure you specified a gateway in the create order request.
* Check if the website is correctly configured for <Glossary>direct</Glossary> requests.
* For payment components, check if the correct API token is used. Do not use an API key.

***

### 1024: Transaction declined

For Pay After Delivery and card orders:

* The `customer` data may be incorrect.
* The transaction was flagged in our [fraud check](/docs/uncleared/).
* We considered the customerâ€™s risk profile unacceptable.

Check that the:

* Card details are correct
* Customer details are correct
* Customer details match the credit details

If your are using Cloudflare, the customer's `ip_address` might be overwritten.\
To provide the correct IP address, see Cloudflare â€“ <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170786-Restoring-original-visitor-IPs" target="_blank">Restoring original visitor IPs</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style={{fontSize:'12px',color:'#8b929e'}} />.

**ðŸ’¡ Tip!** For card payments, use the <a href="https://docs.multisafepay.com/reference/getorder" target="_blank">Get order</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style={{fontSize:'12px',color:'#8b929e'}} /> request and check the response details to learn more about the decline reason.

***

### 1025: Multiple currencies in cart

The `shopping_cart` contains multiple currencies.

Ensure all items in the cart use the same currency.

***

### 1026: Cart currency different to order currency

The order `currency` must match the currency of all items in the shopping cart.

***

### 1027: Cart amount must equal order amount

The total order `amount` must be equal to the sum of the items in the shopping cart.

Check that all amounts are correct.

For Pay After Delivery orders, we check the amount for each item, the total amount, and the VAT. Ensure you provide the VAT amount. If no VAT was applied, enter 0%.

***

### 1028: Incorrect custom tax rate

A `tax_tables.rate` is invalid.

Check that the tax rate specified was formatted correctly as #.##, e.g. 0.19.

***

### 1029: Incorrect item tax rate

Some payment methods require in the create order request:

* `tax_table`
* An array of items
* The total amount

This error occurs if the tax rate calculated based on the tax table provided doesnâ€™t match the order items and order total.

We recalculate the amount for each item (excluding tax) and the taxes (only 9% or 21%), and then the total amount. This should match the total order amount.

Check that:

* The tax tables provided match the values used to calculate the tax owing in your <Glossary>backend</Glossary>.
* You provided the amount for all items:
  * Excluding total tax
  * Including total tax

***

### 1030: Incorrect item currency

The `currency` for an item in the shopping cart is not supported in your MultiSafepay account.

For FastCheckout and Pay After Delivery orders, check that the currency is valid.

***

### 1031: Incorrect item price

The `unit_price` of an item in the shopping cart is incorrect.

***

### 1032: Invalid API key

The API key is not valid.

Check that:

* You used the correct [website API key](/docs/sites#site-id-api-key-and-security-code).
* The API key was formatted correctly.
* You used a live key in the live environment, and a test key in the test environment.

***

### 1033: Error fetching refund information

***

### 1034: Cannot refund transaction

The refund cannot be processed.

Check:

* That the sum of any partial refunds doesnâ€™t exceed the original order amount
* That you can make <Glossary>payouts</Glossary> from your account balance
* If the order was cancelled or has already been refunded
* If the same refund was paid within in a short period of time. If a second refund for the same amount is requested within 5 minutes, MultiSafepay rejects the second request to avoid double processing. Refunds sent in batches via the API cause this error because the process is so quick. To avoid this error, delay refund requests by at least 1 second.

***

### 1035: Invalid signature

The MD5 signature supplied with the message doesnâ€™t match the message contents for the transaction.

***

### 1036: Invalid iDEAL issuer ID

The bank identifier for a <Glossary>direct</Glossary> iDEAL transaction was not recognized.

Check:

* The identifier is formatted correctly.
* If you used a real bank identifier in the test environment, or a test identifier in the live environment.

See [List iDEAL issuers](/reference/listidealissuers/).

***

### 5001: Cart data not validated
