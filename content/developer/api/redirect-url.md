The `redirect_url` is the URL of your success/thank you page, where customers are directed after successfully completing payment, or if the transaction status is **Uncleared**.   

**Note:** Customers never see an **Uncleared** status. They are still redirected to the success page. For more information, see [Evaluating Uncleared transactions](/credit-cards-user-guide/uncleared-transactions/).
