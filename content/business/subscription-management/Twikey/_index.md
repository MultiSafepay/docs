Our partner Twikey offers an online tool for managing and collecting subscriptions that includes [SEPA direct debit mandate management](https://www.twikey.com/solution/mandate.html).

Customers can complete payments via:

- A [MultiSafepay payment link](/payments/checkout/payment-link/) added to your invoice. See Twikey â€“ [Naadloze integratie MultiSafepay](https://www.twikey.com/nl/partner/multisafepay.html).
- A one-off payment link or QR code sent via Twikey, e.g. by email, WhatsApp, SMS

To integrate with MultiSafepay, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Twikey account.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **MultiSafepay**.
3. Enter your [MultiSafepay API key](/getting-started/set-up-your-account/user-guide/viewing-your-api-key/).
