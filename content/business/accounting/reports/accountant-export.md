The Accountant export lists all successful incoming and outgoing transactions, including the:

- Amount
- Payment method
- [Transaction status](/payments/multisafepay-statuses/) (at the time the report was generated)

{{< details title="Supported formats" >}}

* CAMT053
* CODA
* CSV
* MT940
* XLS
* XLSX

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Exclusions" >}}
&nbsp;  
MultiSafepay does not collect funds for PayPal. Therefore, PayPal transactions don't automatically appear in the Accountant export. To include them, in your [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend), make sure the transaction status is set to **Completed**.

## Generating Accountant exports

To generate an Accountant export, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your live [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), or for test reports, your [MultiSafepay test account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Reports** > **Accountant export**.
3. From the **Date selection** dropdown, select the relevant timeframe (last 2 years only), and then click **Apply**.
4. From the **Report type** dropdown, select the relevant export format. 
5. **Group costs in 1 record** toggle:   
    - **Yes**: Show only the total of all MultiSafepay transaction fees for the selected timeframe.
    - **No**: List each MultiSafepay fee below the matching transaction.
6. Click **Generate report**.

To filter transactions in the Accountant export (e.g. by payment method), see [N-codes for identifying payment methods](/reports/n-codes/).
