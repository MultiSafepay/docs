Our partner MplusKASSA offers order management software for restaurants, cafes, and hotels, which can integrate with MultiSafepay.

**Note:** When customers successfully complete payment with iDEAL, they don't always return to your site, which can briefly delay the transaction status changing to **Completed**. If your business model requires you to retrieve the status as quickly as possible, MultiSafepay can enable a script to query iDEAL 5 times in the first minute, and then every minute until **Completed**.  

To discuss, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
