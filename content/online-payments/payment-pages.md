Payment pages are hosted by MultiSafepay and are the easiest way to integrate all payment methods. 

They are completely secure, fully mobile responsive, and can be styled to fit the look and feel of your site.

# How it works

A customer selects a payment method at checkout, and is redirected to a secure page to complete payment with a URL starting with `payv2.multisafepay.com`.

If you specify a payment method gateway, the page is tailored for that payment method. For example, for Visa, the page includes fields for the customer to enter their credit card details.  

If you don't specify a gateway, all payment methods enabled in your account appear on the payment page.

# Activation

You can activate payment pages yourself in your dashboard.

You can manually generate a [link to a payment page](/payment-links/) to send to a customer to complete payment. 

## Payment methods

If a customer's country is unclear or your integration doesn't let you provide the correct country code, consider displaying **all** your enabled payment methods on the payment page. This is not supported for the deprecated version.
