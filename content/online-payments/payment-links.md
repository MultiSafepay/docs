You can manually generate a link to a [payment page](/payment-pages/) to pass to a customer to complete payment. 

# How it works

Use cases include:

- A customer wants to adjust an existing order and instead of starting over with a new order.
- You need to create a transaction for a manually generated order.
- MultiSafepay collects a payment for an amount that doesn't match any order. If you accept the payment, you need to manually generate a payment link and email it to <support@multisafepay.com>
- A [Bank Transfer](/bank-transfer/) transaction has expired.

# Activation

No activation is required.

# Integration

You can generate payment links via the API:

- API reference â€“ [Create order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder) > Payment page/link
- API recipe â€“ [Create a payment page/link](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder)

## Link lifetimes

The lifetime of a payment link is how long it remains active for the customer to access the payment page and complete payment. The default is 30 days.

<details id="how-to-adjust-link-lifetimes">
<summary>How to adjust link lifetimes</summary>
<br>

To set or adjust the lifetime of a payment link, see API reference â€“ [Create order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder): `days_active` parameter.

**Note:** This is different to [transaction expiration times per payment method](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/transaction-expiration). 

This only applies to certain payment methods:

| Adjustable | Non-adjustable |
|---|---|
| Banking methods, except SEPA Direct Debit | SEPA Direct Debit |
| Gift cards | Edenred, Paysafecard |
| Wallets | PayPal â€“ Links are valid for 14 days. The lifetime is set by PayPal. |
| Credit cards |  |

</details>

## Number of attempts

The customer can open the link to the payment page up to 20 times, after which the link is disabled.

Each attempt creates a new transaction. If the customer completes payment in one of these transactions, the [status](/payments-statuses/) of the other transactions remains **initialized** until they expire.

## Payment methods

<details id="supported-payment-methods">
<summary>Supported payment methods</summary>
<br>

**All** payment methods are supported. 

The payment page displays **all** payment methods activated for the relevant website. If you want to display specific payment methods, you need to create a new website profile with only the relevant methods activated.
