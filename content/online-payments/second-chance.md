Second Chance is a MultiSafepay service that automatically emails customers a payment link when they initiate but don't complete a transaction. This helps boost conversion and impulse purchases. The first email is sent 1 hour after the customer initiates the payment, and a second after 24 hours.

Second Chance emails are also sent for manually generated [payment links](/payment-links/) if the customer doesn't click the link to complete payment.

# Requirements

- Under the [GDPR](/gdpr), you must obtain documented consent from the customer to send Second Chance emails.
- You must include the customer's email address in the transaction API request.
- Second Chance emails cannot be activated or sent to the customer while the status of the original transaction is **Uncleared**, or once it is **Completed**.
- Payment links in Second Chance emails have the same lifetime as the original payment link, which is set to 30 days by default.

## Potential errors

- Second Chance emails can cause issues when running an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
- If you have another order for the same total amount with the same customer email address completed in the last 120 minutes, Second Chance emails are suppressed.

<summary>Errors in external plugins</summary>
<br>

Second Chance emails can create conflicts with external warehouse systems. In some cases, this can be resolved using a cron job. However, this is not always a stable solution.

For example, when a customer cancels an order in the webshop, they can still pay for it using Second Chance within 30 days or a specified time frame. For more information, see API reference - [Create order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder) > `days_active` parameter.

If a cancelled order is subsequently paid for, MultiSafepay reopens the order in the webshop. A warehouse system may have already released the reservation on the order when it received **Cancelled** status, or may consider the **Cancelled** status permanent. As result, the items the customer ordered may no longer be available or in stock.
