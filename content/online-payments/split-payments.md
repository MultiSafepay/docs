Split Payments lets you divide an incoming transaction amount between two or more MultiSafepay accounts. 

# How it works

This feature is supported for all [account types](/docs/create-account/) and affiliations, e.g.:

- Partner/primary accounts, e.g. for mixed baskets where customers buy products from multiple affiliated merchants in a single transaction on your marketplace
- Affiliated accounts, e.g. for franchises splitting 10% of all incoming transactions to the linked primary account

You can split payments by percentage, a fixed amount, or by both.

# Activation
None.

# Integration

See API recipe â€“ [Split a payment](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/recipes/split-a-payment).

Split Payments are not supported in our [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/).
