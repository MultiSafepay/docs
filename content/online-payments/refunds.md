    - **Amount** field the amount to refund.  
    - **IBAN** field the IBAN of the account you want to refund to.
    - **Reason/Description** field the reason for the refund. 
5. Click **Continue**.
6. Under **Refund confirmation**, check that the description and amount are correct, and then click **Confirm**.
    A new order is created for the refund, with status **reserved** or **initialized**.
7. Under **Related transactions**, select the **ID** of the refund order.
8. Under **Order summary**, click **Accept**.
