Split Payments lets you divide an incoming transaction amount between two or more MultiSafepay accounts.

# How it works

This feature is supported for all [account types](/docs/create-account/) and affiliations, e.g.:

* Partner/primary accounts, e.g. for mixed baskets where customers buy products from multiple affiliated merchants in a single transaction on your marketplace
* Affiliated accounts, e.g. for franchises splitting 10% of all incoming transactions to the linked primary account

You can split payments by percentage, a fixed amount, or by both.

# Activation

The Split Payments feature is available by default for all MultiSafepay accounts.

# Integration
