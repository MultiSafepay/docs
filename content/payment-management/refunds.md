This page provides information about processing refunds with MultiSafepay. 

- Refunds can only be processed for payments linked to transactions, otherwise the customer receives credit on their invoice instead.
- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your account balance.
- Customers receive refunds in the bank account they originally paid from.

# Full and partial refunds

You can process refunds:

- Via our API â€“ [Refund order](/reference/refundorder/)
- In most of our [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/)
- Via your dashboard

# User guide

## Batches

## Cancellation

You can cancel a refund via MultiSafepay while the status is **Initialized** or **Reserved**, which is until midnight on the day the refund was initiated.

    - **Reason/Description** field the reason for the refund.

    A new order is created for the refund, with status **reserved** or **Initialized**.
7. Under **Related transactions**, select the **ID** of the refund order.
8. Under **Order summary**, click **Accept**.
9. In the **Add transaction comment** field, add a comment, and then click **Add**.
