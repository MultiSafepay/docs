After completing payment process, MultiSafepay redirects the customer to a success ("thank you") page, or to the next confirmation step where necessary. 

If `payment_options.redirect_url` in your [create order](/reference/createorder) request is:

- Set to your success page URL, we redirect the customer there (or to the next step in the process)
- **Not** set, we redirect the customer to a MultiSafepay success page (or to the next step in the process)

**Note: redirection to the success page should not be taken as a guarantor of completed payment; To check the status of a payment, you can rely on the notification.

# Add order details to your success page

You can retrieve details about a transaction to include on your success page, e.g. payment details,`transaction_status`, `var1/2/3` content, `custom_info` content. 

1. In your [create order](/reference/createorder) request, set the URL to your success page in `payment_options.redirect_url`.
2. The `transaction_id` is appended as a query parameter to the URL.
3. To retrieve the order details, make a [get order](/reference/getorder) request from your server using the `transaction_id`.
4. Inject the details into your success page in your <<glossary:backend>>.

# Dynamically style a MultiSafepay success page

You can dynamically style the MultiSafepay success page in the create order request in the same way as a [payment page](/docs/payment-pages/).
