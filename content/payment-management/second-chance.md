Second Chance is a MultiSafepay solution that automatically emails customers a payment link when they initiate but don't complete a transaction. This helps boost <Glossary>conversion</Glossary> and impulse purchases.

# How it works

Second Chance emails are sent:

* 1 hour after the customer initiates the payment, and a second email after 24 hours.
* For manually generated [payment links](/docs/payment-links/) if the customer doesn't click the link to complete payment.
* For a transaction for the same customer, email address, merchant, and website as a previous transaction initiated **more than** 120 minutes ago, even if the amount is different.

Second Chance emails are **not** sent:

* While the status of the original transaction is **Uncleared**, **Shipped**, or **Completed**
* For [recurring payments](/docs/recurring-payments/)
* If you have another **Completed** transaction with the same `order_id` and/or `session_id`
* For each separate transaction for orders with multiple linked transactions (one email is sent per `order_id` and `session_id`
* For a transaction for the same customer, email address, merchant, and website as a previous transaction initiated **less than** 120 minutes ago, even if the amount is different.

# Prerequisites

* Under the [GDPR](/docs/gdpr/), you must obtain documented consent from the customer to send Second Chance emails.
* You must include the customer's email address in the transaction API request.

See [Email styling](/docs/email-styling/) > Select the **Second Chance email (to customer)** template.

## Payment link lifetimes

Payment links in Second Chance emails have the same lifetime as the original payment link, which is set to 30 days by default.

<details id="how-to-adjust-link-lifetimes">
  <summary>How to adjust link lifetimes</summary>

  <br />

  To set or adjust the lifetime of a payment link, see API reference ‚Äì [Create order](/reference/createorder/): `days_active` parameter.

  **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This is different to [transaction expiration times per payment method](/reference/transaction-expiration/).

  This only applies to certain payment methods:

  | Adjustable                            | Non-adjustable                                                       |
  | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Banking methods, except direct debits | Direct debits                                                        |
  | Gift cards                            | Edenred, Paysafecard                                                 |
  | Wallets                               | PayPal ‚Äì Links are valid for 14 days. The lifetime is set by PayPal. |
</details>

## Payment methods

<details id="supported-payment-methods">
  <summary>Supported payment methods</summary>

  <br />

  Most payment methods are supported, **except for**:

  * [Bank transfer](/docs/bank-transfer/)
  * [E-Invoicing](/docs/e-invoicing/)
  * [PayPal](/docs/paypal/)
  * [Direct debit](/docs/direct-debit/)
  * [Pay After Delivery](/docs/pay-after-delivery/)
</details>

## Potential errors

* Second Chance emails can cause issues when running an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
* If you have another <Glossary>order</Glossary> for the same total amount with the same customer email address completed in the last 120 minutes, Second Chance emails are suppressed.

<details id="errors-in-external-plugins">
  <summary>Errors in external plugins</summary>

  <br />

  Second Chance emails can create conflicts with external warehouse systems. In some cases, this can be resolved using a cron job. However, this is not always a stable solution.

  For example, when a customer cancels an <Glossary>order</Glossary> in the webshop, they can still pay for it using Second Chance within 30 days or a specified time frame. For more information, see API reference ‚Äì [Create order](/reference/createorder/) > `days_active` parameter.

  If a cancelled order is subsequently paid for, MultiSafepay reopens the order in the webshop. A warehouse system may have already released the reservation on the order when it received **Cancelled** status, or may consider the **Cancelled** status permanent. As result, the items the customer ordered may no longer be available or in stock.
