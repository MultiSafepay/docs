Second Chance is a MultiSafepay solution that automatically emails customers a payment link when they initiate but don't complete a transaction. This helps boost <<glossary:conversion>> and impulse purchases. 

# How it works

Second Chance emails are sent:

- 1 hour after the customer initiates the payment, and a second email after 24 hours.
- For manually generated [payment links](/docs/payment-links/) if the customer doesn't click the link to complete payment.
- For a transaction for the same customer, email address, merchant, and site as a previous transaction initiated **more than** 120 minutes ago, even if the amount is different.

Second Chance emails are **not** sent:

- While the status of the original transaction is **Uncleared**, **Shipped**, or **Completed**
- For [recurring payments](/docs/recurring-payments/)
- If you have another **Completed** transaction with the same `order_id` and/or `session_id`
- For each separate transaction for orders with multiple linked transactions (one email is sent per `order_id` and `session_id`
- For a transaction for the same customer, email address, merchant, and site as a previous transaction initiated **less than** 120 minutes ago, even if the amount is different.


# Prerequisites

- Under the [GDPR](/docs/gdpr/), you must obtain documented consent from the customer to send Second Chance emails.

## Styling

You can style Second Chance email templates to match your brand's look and feel.

See [Email styling](/docs/email-styling/) > Select the **Second Chance email (to customer)** template.

## Payment link lifetimes

Payment links in Second Chance emails have the same lifetime as the original payment link, which is set to 30 days by default.

<details id="how-to-adjust-link-lifetimes">
<summary>How to adjust link lifetimes</summary>
<br>

To set or adjust the lifetime of a payment link, see API reference ‚Äì [Create order](/reference/createorder/): `days_active` parameter.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This is different to [transaction expiration times per payment method](/reference/transaction-expiration/). 

This only applies to certain payment methods:

| Adjustable | Non-adjustable |
|---|---|
| Banking methods, except direct debits | Direct debits |
| Gift cards | Edenred, Paysafecard |
| Wallets | PayPal ‚Äì Links are valid for 14 days. The lifetime is set by PayPal. |

</details>

## Payment methods

<details id="supported-payment-methods">
<summary>Supported payment methods</summary>
<br>

Most payment methods are supported, **except for**: 

- [Bank transfer](/docs/bank-transfer/)
- [E-Invoicing](/docs/e-invoicing/)
- [PayPal](/docs/paypal/)
- [Direct debit](/docs/direct-debit/)
- [Pay After Delivery](/docs/pay-after-delivery/)

</details>

## Potential errors

- Second Chance emails can cause issues when running an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
- If you have another <<glossary:order>> for the same total amount with the same customer email address completed in the last 120 minutes, Second Chance emails are suppressed.

<details id="errors-in-external-plugins">
<summary>Errors in external plugins</summary>
<br>

Second Chance emails can create conflicts with external warehouse systems. In some cases, this can be resolved using a cron job. However, this is not always a stable solution.

For example, when a customer cancels an <<glossary:order>> in the webshop, they can still pay for it using Second Chance within 30 days or a specified time frame. For more information, see API reference ‚Äì [Create order](/reference/createorder/) > `days_active` parameter.

If a cancelled order is subsequently paid for, MultiSafepay reopens the order in the webshop. A warehouse system may have already released the reservation on the order when it received **Cancelled** status, or may consider the **Cancelled** status permanent. As result, the items the customer ordered may no longer be available or in stock.
