Recurring payments is a MultiSafepay solution that securely stores payment details to enable quick, easy repeat payments.

# How it works

* **One-click payments:** The customer selects stored details for faster checkout.
* **Subscriptions:** You use the token to collect payments at specific intervals, e.g. weekly, monthly.
* **Unscheduled payments:** You use the token for event-triggered payments, e.g. mobile top-up when no credit left on phone.

MultiSafepay encrypts customers' sensitive payment details during an initial payment for secure storage, and provides you with a non-sensitive identifier for the details known as a "token". Customers can save multiple tokens.

Subsequent payments are exempt from [SCA and 2FA](/docs/psd2/).\
MultiSafepay is responsible for [PCI DSS](/docs/pci-dss/) compliant storage of payment details.

Tokens are stored at account level rather than website level. If you operate multiple websites from a single MultiSafepay account, you can also offer cross-domain recurring payments, i.e. tokenize a customer's details on Website A and offer one-click payments on Website B.

## Supported payment methods

For both initial and subsequent payments:

* Cards: American Express, Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa
* Direct debit ‚Äì First you need to provide us with some information. <br /> See Direct debit ‚Äì [Activation](/docs/direct-debit/#activation).

For initial payments then subsequent payments via direct debit:

* Bancontact - [Bancontact WIP](/docs/bancontact#bancontact-wip-service)
* iDEAL

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:**  For subsequent payments to be successful via direct debit, ensure that direct debit [is activated in your MultiSafepay account](/docs/direct-debit/#activation).

¬†**üí° Tip!** Test every payment method flow you intend to use.

## Initial payment

1. The customer gives you consent to store their payment details and verifies their identity with 3D Secure.
2. MultiSafepay encrypts the payment details during processing and stores them securely on our servers. We return to you a non-sensitive token that references the encrypted payment details.
3. You can use the token to process recurring payments without needing to handle or store sensitive payment details.

### Zero Authorization

Optionally, you can set the amount for the initial payment `0`. No funds are transferred but a token is created (if the payment details are valid).

See [Zero Authorization](/docs/zero-authorization/).

## Subsequent payments: Customer-initiated

1. You display the customer's available tokens at checkout, e.g. `MASTERCARD **43`.
2. The customer selects a token and confirms payment. They don't need to re-provide any payment details or pass 3D Secure authentication again.
3. You include the token in the request to MultiSafepay.
4. MultiSafepay decrypts the payment details and processes the payment.

This is also known as "one-click payment".

## Subsequent payments: Merchant-initiated

There are two common use cases for merchant-initiated subsequent payments:

* Subscriptions
* Unscheduled payments

<br />

1. The customer must give consent (once only).
2. You include the token in the request to MultiSafepay.
3. MultiSafepay decrypts the payment details and processes the payment.

# Integration

## Payment component

Our [payment components](/docs/payment-components) support recurring payments.

To enable them, see payment component:

* [Single payment method](/docs/payment-component-single/#how-to-process-recurring-payments)
* [Multiple payment methods](/docs/payment-component-multiple/#how-to-process-recurring-payments)

## Recurring models

MultiSafepay offers three recurring models:

* `cardOnFile` (one-click payments)
* `subscription`
* `unscheduled` (event-triggered)

Our API and <a href="https://github.com/MultiSafepay/php-sdk" target="_blank">PHP SDK</a> <i className="fa fa-external-link" style={{fontSize:'12px',color:'#8b929e'}} /> support all three models.\
Our [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/) use `cardOnFile` only.

## Ready-made integrations

You must have **both** card payments and recurring payments enabled for your MultiSafepay account.
