### Redirect, Flexible 3D set on _true_ 

It is mandatory to enable Flexible 3D secure processing in this call, even when Dynamic 3D rules could set the settings to disable it.

Flexible 3D is a feature that allows you to enable/disable 3D secure at API level. The Flexible 3D mandates whether or not a transaction should be completed with the 3D secure verification or not.

When Flexible 3D is set on _true_, the authentication verification is mandatory to finalize and release a successful payment. Credit card transactions which are processed without the 3D Secure protocol, are now required to complete the 3D secure verification. Activating Flexible 3D secure will override the rules of the Dynamic 3D settings, meaning that the payment will be enrolled with a 3D Secure authentication.
