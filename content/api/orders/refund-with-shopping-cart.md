### Refund with shopping cart
Refund [post-payment](/payments/methods/billing-suite/) orders that include a `shopping_cart` object.

1. Make a `GET /orders/{id}` request to retrieve the items in the shopping cart.

2. Add or remove items in the `POST /orders/{id}/refunds` request, depending on the type of post-payment method:    
    - For Klarna, add a "copy" of the item to refund with a negative `unit_price`.  
    - For all other post-payment methods, set a negative `quantity`.
&nbsp;      
3. Make sure that all data in the items matches the original transaction (except for the `quantity` or `unit_price`).

In the example, two out of three geometric candle holders were refunded. The exact same `merchant_item_id`, `tax_table_selector` and `unit_price` were provided.

**Parameter**

`checkout_data` | object | required
