## Tokenization order

[Tokenization](/payments/features/tokenization) is the process of storing payment details as encrypted tokens for future payments, e.g. recurring transactions.

This section lists the API requests and parameters for different tokenization orders.

See also [Manage tokens](/api/#manage-tokens).
