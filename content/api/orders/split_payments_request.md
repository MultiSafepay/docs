## Split Payments
The split payment tool allows you to split the amount of a transaction over several MultiSafepay accounts. [Merchants](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#merchant) can choose to split payments based on percentage, a fixed amount or a combination of the two.

Read more about [split payments](/tools/split-payments) on our documentation page.
