## Recurring Payment

Recurring Payments can be done using Credit Cards (VISA, Mastercard) and SEPA Direct Debit.    

iDEAL and SOFORT Banking can be used for an initial payment as well, and followed up by a recurring payment with SEPA Direct Debit. A merchant account with recurring payment enabled will receive a recurring ID in the transaction response. The recurring ID can be used for future transactions.
