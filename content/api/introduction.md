# API Reference
<hr class="separator">

Welcome to the MultiSafepay API Reference (``JSON`` gateway).

### Navigating the API Reference

The **left column** contains a table of contents. 

The **middle column** provides detailed information about each topic and API request, including parameters and data types.

The **right column** shows example ``JSON`` requests and responses.

### Using our API

You can use our API to make requests, for example, to:

- [Create transactions](#orders)
- [Update transactions](#update-an-order)
- [Process refunds](#create-a-refund)
- [Retrieve information about transactions](#retrieve-an-order)

Advanced requests include making [split payments](#split-payments) and [recurring payments](#recurring-payment).

You can also use our API to build a custom integration. You can test your integration in the [``TEST`` environment](#environments). See also our [Postman collection](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/multisafepay-postman-collection) of sample requests.
