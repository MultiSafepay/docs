# API Reference
<hr class="separator">

Welcome to the MultiSafepay API Reference (``JSON`` gateway).

### How to navigate the API Reference

The **left column** contains an overview of our ``JSON`` API.
By clicking on a topic, you can find specific information about the specific API request.

The **middle column** provides the detailed information you are looking for.
This contains a description of how to use the API request and a reference for the parameters and types involved.

The **right column** shows examples of the specific ``JSON`` request and response which can be expected.

### What our API offers:

Our API enables you to perform different calls through which you can [start transactions](#create-an-order), [update transactions](#update-an-order), [perform refunds](#create-a-refund) and [receive information about transactions](#retrieve-an-order)

The API also offers advanced operations to enable you to use [split payments](#split-payments) and [recurring payments](#recurring-payment)

We encourage you to study this API and start implementing your custom integration against our [``TEST`` environment](#environments)

For any questions, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
