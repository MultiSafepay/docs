# Gateways
<hr class="separator">

In our API, a payment method is identified as `gateway`. 

To activate payment methods, see [Activating payment methods](/payments/activating-payment-methods/).

Use the gateway requests to:

- [List all gateways](https://api-docs.multisafepay.com/reference/listgateways)
- [Get a gateway](https://api-docs.multisafepay.com/reference/getgateway)
- [List iDEAL issuers](https://api-docs.multisafepay.com/reference/listidealissuers)
