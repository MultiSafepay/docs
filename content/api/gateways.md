# Gateways
<hr class="separator">

In our API, a payment method is identified as `gateway`. 

To activate payment methods, see [Activating payment methods](/account/activating-payment-methods/).

Use the gateway requests to:

- [Retrieve all activated gateways](/api/#retrieve-activated-gateways)
- [Retrieve a single activated gateway](/api/#retrieve-a-gateway)
- [Retrieve all issuers for a gateway](/api/#retrieve-gateway-issuers)
