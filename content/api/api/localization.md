## Localization

For all requests, MultiSafepay provides an optional localization parameter which is used to specify a language used to display gateway information and other messages in the responses. To get a localized response for any request simply add the [ISO 639-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) language code to the query string of any request. The default language is English.
