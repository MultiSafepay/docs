## Authentication

All requests to the MultiSafepay API require authentication. 

Include your [website API key](/set-up-your-account/site-id-api-key-secure-code) as an HTTP header in your request: `api_key`

**Note**: Always keep your API keys secure. Publicly exposing your credentials can compromise your account.
