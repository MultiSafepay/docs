## Environments

MultiSafepay provides a TEST environment and a LIVE environment. The TEST environment is useful for developing and testing a new integration with our API as no real transactions are able to be processed. Once the integration has been developed processing real transactions is as simple as addressing the LIVE API and updating the API Key being used.
