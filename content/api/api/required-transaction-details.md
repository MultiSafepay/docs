## Required transaction details

As a [PSP](/getting-started/glossary/#payment-service-provider-psp), MultiSafepay is obliged by law to monitor transactions, merchants, and customers. We have to know the type of product or service involved in each transaction, and who is buying and selling.

For each transaction, you must include details about the product and the customer's:

- Name
- IP address
- Country
- Email address

If you fail to provide this information, we may need to carry out extra screening and may request copies of invoices for specific orders.
