## Discount added as order rule (which is non-refundable)
Adding a discount as an order rule is a common way to add a discount before submitting a transaction request at MultiSafepay. However, adding a discount as an order rule may result in a conflict when partially refunding a post-paid [payment method](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-method) transaction. This is most common when the discount is a percentage. Adding a discount as a seperate discount rule, will conflict when partially refunding a post-paid payment method transaction as the negative amount cannot be undone. It is not possible to partially refund a negative amount that is added as a discount rule.
