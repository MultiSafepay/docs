## American Express

- See also Payment methods â€“ [American Express](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/american-express).  
- Redirect only.

**Parameters**

----------------
`type` | string | required

The payment flow for the checkout process.  
Options: `redirect`.  

----------------
`order_id` | string | required

Your unique identifier for the order.  
Format: Maximum 50 characters.

----------------
`gateway` | string | required

The gateway identifier.  
Fixed value: `AMEX`.

**Note:** We also offer a generic [CREDITCARD](/api/#credit-cards) gateway. This can save space in mobile checkouts, but customers can't immediately see which credit cards are supported. When the customer enters the first digits of their card number, the relevant credit card logo appears automatically.

----------------
`currency` | string | required

The currency you want the customer to pay in.   
Format: [ISO-4217 currency codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html).  

----------------
`amount` | integer | required

The amount (in cents) the customer needs to pay.

----------------
`description` | string | required

The order description that appears in your MultiSafepay account and on the customer's bank statement (if supported by the customer's bank).   
Format: Maximum 200 characters.   
HTML is **not** supported. Use the `items` or `shopping_cart` objects for this.

----------------
`payment_options` | object | required

See [payment_options (object)](/api/#payment-options-object).

----------------
`customer` | object | required

See [customer (object)](/api/#customer-object).

**Response**

----------------
`payment_url` | string 

The URL of the page where the customer is redirected from your checkout to complete payment, which may be hosted by [MultiSafepay](/payments/checkout/payment-pages/), the [issuer](/getting-started/glossary/#issuer), or the payment method.
