## Klarna
### Redirect - Klarna
Creates a Klarna [Redirect](/faq/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect) order to be paid after delivery

Processing transactions with Klarna (the old environment) is only available as a Redirect request.

Klarna Payments (the new environment of Klarna) is available as a Redirect request, although you may use the Direct request if you have your own integration. The JSON request remains the same for both Klarna and Klarna payments.

* Redirect transaction requires all fields completed properly

* All parameters shown are required field(s)

{{< alert-notice >}} __Please note__: In order for the shopping_cart to work correctly, the shipment item requires a special 'merchant_item_id'. This parameter is called 'msp-shipping' and can be seen in the JSON code. {{< /alert-notice >}}

----------------
__type__ | string

Specifies the payment flow for the checkout process. Options: direct, redirect.

----------------
__forwarded_ip__ | string

The X-FORWARDED-FOR header of the customer request when using a proxy. [More info](/faq/api/ip_address)

Given the nature of this payment method, we recommend you to always require full names (not initials, abbreviations, acronyms).
