* All of the following parameters are required fields.

**Parameters**

Specifies the payment flow for the checkout process. Options: redirect.  

----------------
__gateway__ | string

Fixed value: [MAESTRO](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/maestro)

----------------
__order_id__ | integer / string

Your unique identifier for the order. If the values are numbers only, the type is integer. Otherwise, it is string.

----------------
__currency__ | string

The currency you want the customer to pay in.   
Format: [ISO-4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html).  

----------------
__amount__ | integer

The amount (in cents) that the customer needs to pay.

----------------
__description__ | string

Text that appears with the order in your MultiSafepay account and on the customer's bank statment (if supported by the customer's bank).   
Format: Maximum 200 characters.   
HTML is not supported. Use the `items` or `shopping_cart` objects for this.

__close_window__ | bool (optional)


To display the MultiSafepay payment page in a new window that automatically closes after the payment is completed, set to `True`.
