## Apple Pay
Creates an Apple Pay [Redirect](/developer/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect) order.

* Redirect transaction requires all fields completed properly.

### How to detect Apple Pay on a device

This JavaScript code will _detect_ if Apple Pay is supported on a device. We recommend you to use this code to avoid an error being displayed if the device does not support Apple Pay. 

Please note that the code will still _display_ Apple Pay as a payment method on a non-supported device. We recommend extending the script to your own needs in order to hide Apple Pay.  

* All of the following parameters are required fields.

**Parameters**

----------------
__type__ | string

Specifies the payment flow for the checkout process. Options: redirect.  

----------------
__gateway__ | string

The payment gateway does not need to be specified.

----------------
__order_id__ | integer / string

Your unique identifier for the order. If the values are numbers only, the type is `integer`, otherwise it is `string`. Maximum number of characters: 35.

----------------
__currency__ | string

The currency you want the customer to pay in.   
Format: [ISO-4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html).  

----------------
__amount__ | integer

The amount (in cents) that the customer needs to pay.

----------------
__description__ | string

Text that appears with the order in your MultiSafepay account and on the customer's bank statment (if supported by the customer's bank).   
Format: Maximum 200 characters.   
HTML is not supported. Use the `items` or `shopping_cart` objects for this.

----------------
__payment_options__ | object

Contains the `redirect_url`, `cancel_url` and [`notification_url`](/developer/api/notification-url).

----------------
__notification_url__ | string

Endpoint for MultiSafepay to send status updates and other notifications to.   
For more information, see [notification_url](/developer/api/notification-url).

----------------
__redirect_url__ | string

The page the customer is redirected to after completing payment.   
If the transaction status changes to [**Uncleared**](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/evaluating-uncleared-transactions/), the customer is also redirected to your thank-you page.   
**Note:** Customers never see an **Uncleared** status. They always experience the payment as successful.

----------------
__cancel_url__ | string

The page the customer is redirected to if the payment fails.

----------------

__close_window__ | bool (optional)


To display the MultiSafepay payment page in a new window that automatically closes after the payment is completed, set to `True`.   
Options: `True`, `False`. 

----------------
