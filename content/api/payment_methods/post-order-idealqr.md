## iDEAL QR
See also Payment methods â€“ [iDEAL QR](/payments/methods/banks/idealqr).

- Creates a [redirect](/developer/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect) order.
- All fields must be completed correctly.
- All of the following parameters are required fields.

**Note:** The test environment is not available for iDEAL QR. You can only test transactions in the live environment. 

- If the `min_amount` parameter is not set, the `amount` value is used as the `min_amount` and vice versa.  
- If the `max_amount` parameter is not set, the `amount` is used as the `max_amount`.  
- If you set both `min_amount` and `max_amount` parameters, the `amount` value is ignored.
