# Orders
<hr class="separator">

## Create and manage orders

To process a transaction, you must create an order. There are two main types of orders:

+ `Redirect`: The customer is redirected to a [MultiSafepay payment page](/payment-pages/) (Connect) to complete payment.
+ `Direct`: The transaction is processed directly in the payment method's environment.

For more information, see [Difference between direct and redirect](/developer/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect).

**Note:** All fields must be completed correctly.
