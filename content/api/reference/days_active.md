## days_active / seconds_active

The days or seconds active indicates the lifetime of a payment link.

* If seconds_active is sent in the API request and larger than 0, then seconds_active will be used
* If days_active is sent in the API request then days_active is used
* If nothing is sent, then 30 days will be set by default
* If both seconds_active and days_active are sent in the API request, then seconds_active is used if the value is larger than 0.
