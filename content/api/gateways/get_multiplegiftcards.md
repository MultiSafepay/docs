| Parameter           | Type   | Description |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| include=coupons            | string | Specify comma delimited additional payment method types. |

Adding the ```coupons``` value to your GET request will **include** all your webshop's available giftcards in the response. See the response example on the side.

If the parameter ```Ã¬nclude=coupons``` is not added in the retrieve gateway request, only one coupon will be displayed in the response.
