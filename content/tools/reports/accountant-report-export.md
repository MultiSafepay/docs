MultiSafepay offers the possibility to export Accountant reports in several formats: __CAMT053, CODA, CSV, MT940, XLS, XLSX.__

In order to create an export, please use the following steps:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Go to _Reports_ and select _Accountant export_
3. Fill in the date selection
4. Choose the report format: CAMT053, CODA, CSV, MT940, XLS, XLSX
5. Generate report.

In the report, all (processed) incoming and outgoing completed transactions are displayed in the specified period in which you generate the report, providing you insights on an individual level, as well as of all the associated costs.

__MultiSafepay does not collect funds for PayPal. Therefore, PayPal transactions do not appear in the accountant export. Make sure that the financial status is set to _Completed_ in your backend. This will then be reflected in the accountant export.__
