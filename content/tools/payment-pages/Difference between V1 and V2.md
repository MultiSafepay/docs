A lot of changes have been made with the release of our V2 payment page.  Although a merchant can still use the V1 payment page without problems, we strongly recommend to take the step and change over to our newest payment page version to make use of the MultiSafepay platform without limitations. 

## Payment methods
Some of the MultiSafepay payment methods and gift cards are only available on the V2 payment page. When new payment methods get added to the MultiSafepay platform, we cannot guarantee that these payment methods will work on the V1 version.

## Request and responses
The requests and responses from and to the MultiSafepay server, are processed quicker on the V2 payment page compared to the V1 payment page.

## Responsive
The responsive design of the V2 payment page is developed to be used across different types of devices and browsers. Whether your customer is paying on a desktop,tablet or mobile, give your customers a seemless customer experience.

## Dynamic template
One of our main V2 futures, is the possibility to implement the dynamic payment template into your API integration. This way you can customize the payment page without any hassle.

## Countries/translations
