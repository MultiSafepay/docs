For merchants with a custom integration via [JSON API MultiSafepay](/api/), we also offers dynamic styling of the templates. This means you can change the look and feel of a payment page per transaction.

There are two options to dynamically style the payment page:

## 1. Load a saved template
Whenever you have stored a template, you can call it through the first-level JSON object "template_id": "value of the template".

## 2. Provide 'template' object structure within the transaction request
MultiSafepay also offers real-time styling of the templates. This means you can change the look and feel of a payment page per transaction on the fly. See the template code on our [API documentation page](https://docs.multisafepay.com/api/#dynamic-styling).
