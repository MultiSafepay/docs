MultiSafepay's payment pages are the quickest, easiest, and most secure way of accepting online payments. By default, they use MultiSafepay branding and styling. We recommend styling the payment pages to be consistent with your website through your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).

For support, email the Integration team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

To style payment page templates, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Website settings** > **Website**.
3. Click the **Template** button. 
4. Use the WYSIWYG editor to style the payment page template.
    - Choosing colors: In the left menu, a color chart appears when you click on the field of a page element. You can also enter a [Hex color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) in the input field next to it.
    - Selecting a logo or header image: In **Settings** > **Payment page templates**, upload files for logos or header backgrounds. They may take up to 5 minutes to process, and then automatically appear in the dropdown list in the editor.

5. To save the finished template to the relevant website, click **Submit website**. 

### Other tips
If you have more than one template and want to set one as your default template, use the **Set default** option. You can also give this template a name which forms the `template_id`. 

To edit saved templates, click the **Edit template** button in the top left corner.

To apply the style from a template for another website in your account, click the **Apply style from** button in the top right corner. Save the template to the relevant website.

To use dynamic styling, see [Dynamic styling payment pages](/tools/payment-pages/dynamic-styling-payment-pages/).
