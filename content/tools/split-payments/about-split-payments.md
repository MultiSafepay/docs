Split payments let you spread a transaction amount over several MultiSafepay accounts. You could, for example, charge a fee for using your platform to other parties. Customers can also pay for products and services from several webshops in a single transaction. 

You can split payments based on percentage, fixed amount, or a combination of the two. 

For more information, see [Processing split payments](/tools/split-payments/how-do-i-get-split-payments).
