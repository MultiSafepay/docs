Split Payments allow a merchant to spread a transaction amount over several MultiSafepay Control accounts. This way, you could for instance charge a fee for use of your platform to other parties. Goods from several online webshops can be charged in a single customer transaction. 

Merchants can choose to split payments based on percentage or a fixed amount.
