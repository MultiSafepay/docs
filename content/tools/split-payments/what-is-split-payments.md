Split Payments allow a merchant to spread a transaction amount over several [MultiSafepay Control]((https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)) accounts. This way, you could for instance charge a fee for use of your platform to other parties. Goods from several online webshops can be charged in a single customer transaction. 

Merchants can choose to split payments based on percentage, fixed amount or a combination of the two. 

Please read about [how to process a split payment](/tools/split-payments/how-do-i-get-split-payments) to understand further how this tool works.
