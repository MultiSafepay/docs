### MultiSafepay Control
Information regarding manually generating a payment link by using your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) can be found in our in-depth [documentation](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/multisafepay-control/manually-generated-payment-link)

### MultiSafepay app

If you wish to generate a payment link by using the MultiSafepay app, this can simply be executed by following these instructions:

1. Go to Tools â€“> _Payment link generator_
2. Fill in the required fields
3. Click _Generate payment link_
4. A QR code will be generated which can be used.



### About QR code
QR codes allow the final customer to pay without manual input, reducing input errors.

Once you obtained the QR code, it can be saved on your device and be sent to your customer. The customer can now scan the QR code with a dedicated app on his phone. This will automatically open the MultiSafepay payment page filled with the data used during the payment link generator tool.

_Note: A QR code cannot be directly generated with the API._
