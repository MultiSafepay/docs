## Activation

The activation of Zero Authorization takes place in the MultiSafepay Control.Contact our screening department at <risk@multisafepay.com>

After our screening department has enabled this feature for the website you selected, it is important to view the [API documentation] regarding Zero Authorization. This is not incorporated in our [ecommerce integrations](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations) by default, but it can be added through customization from your side.

Do you have any questions about this process? Contact our Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
