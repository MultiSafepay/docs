## Activation

The activation of Zero Authorization takes place in the MultiSafepay Control. Please contact our screening department at <risk@multisafepay.com>

After our screening department has enabled this feature for the website you selected, it is important to view the [API documentation] regarding Zero Authorization. This is not incorporated in our plugins by default, but it can be added through customization from your side.

Do you have any questions about this process? Please contact our Integrations department at <integration@multisafepay.com>
