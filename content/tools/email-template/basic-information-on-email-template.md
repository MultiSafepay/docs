## What is it? 
An email template is a preformatted and/or prewritten email that you can use to replace with your own content so that you can quickly and easily write and create emails.

MultiSafepay offers a number of options for sending a standard email, for example, a successful payment or a reminder email also known as a Second Chance email and many more. 

> MultiSafepay is unable to customize payment pages or email templates for you, although if you do encounter functionality issues, please contact us at <integration@multisafepay.com>

## Set a template
An email template can be set within your MultiSafepay Control under: _**Settings -> Email template -> Select a website -> Add new template.**_ 

The email template has a view options available. A list of the options available are shown and explained below:

1. **Bank transfer details email (to customer)**\
This is a standard email template to provide the customer with the bank details of MultiSafepay upon selecting the Bank transfer as payment method. 

    Because the payment is processed from within the customer's banking environment and not directly on the payment page, the necessary data is sent to the customer by email. With this payment data, the customer can transfer the payment from their own banking environment to MultiSafepay at a desired time.

    MultiSafepay will only sent the email to the customer when the Bank transafer request is recieved as a redirect requets. Meaning, the customer is redirected to the payment page of MultiSafepay to confirm the placed order. 

    More information about the payment methods Bank transfer available in [Bank transfer, how does it work?](/payment-methods/bank-transfer/#how-it-works)

2. **Chargeback email (to merchant)**\
This email is intended to inform the merchant that a chargeback has taken place. When you, as a merchant, process credit card payments, it is recommended to activate the option to receive a chargeback notification by email.

     When the standard or personalized chargeback email template is set up, it is important to add an email to your account to which the embedded email template can be sent. Place the desired email address under your contact information -> chargeback email in your MultiSafepay Control. One or more email addresses can be added. 

     More information about Chargebacks available in [What is a chargeback?](/faq/chargebacks/what-is-a-chargeback/)

## The importance of locale
A locale is a set of parameters that defines the userâ€™s language, region and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language code and a country/region code (e.g. en_US). A locale can be included to provide localized payment pages for the customer. Use the format ab_CD with [ISO 639](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) language codes and [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) country codes. This will show the desired language for that customer (if supported by MultiSafepay) on both the payment page and the emails sent by MultiSafepay. When left empty or with a unsupported value, en_US, meaning American English, is used as default.

**For example, if an email template is set for a German customer, but the locale is received as en_US, the email template will be sent in English and not in German.**
