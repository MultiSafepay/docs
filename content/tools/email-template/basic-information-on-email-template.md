An email template is a preformatted and/or prewritten email that you can use to replace with your own content so that you can quickly and easily write and create emails.

MultiSafepay offers a number of options for sending a standard email, for example, a successful payment or a reminder email also known as a Second Chance email and many more. 

> MultiSafepay cannot customize payment pages or email templates for you. For functionality support, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

## Set a template
An email template can be set within your MultiSafepay account under: _**Settings > Email template > Select a website > Add new template.**_ 

The email template has a view options available. A list of the options available are shown and explained below:

1. **Bank transfer details email (to customer)**\
This is a standard email template to provide the customer with the bank details of MultiSafepay upon selecting the Bank transfer as payment method. 

    Because the payment is processed from within the customer's banking environment and not directly on the payment page, the necessary data is sent to the customer by email. With this payment data, the customer can transfer the payment from their own banking environment to MultiSafepay at a desired time.

    MultiSafepay will only sent the email to the customer when the Bank transfer request is recieved as a redirect request. Meaning, the customer is redirected to the payment page of MultiSafepay to confirm the placed order.

2. **Chargeback email (to merchant)**\
This email is intended to inform the merchant that a chargeback has taken place. When you, as a merchant, process credit card payments, it is recommended to activate the option to receive a chargeback notification by email.

     When the standard or personalized chargeback email template is set up, it is important to add an email to your account to which the embedded email template can be sent. Place the desired email address under your contact information > chargeback email in your MultiSafepay account. One or more email addresses can be added.

## Setting the locale
A locale is a set of parameters that defines the userâ€™s language and region.

Use the format ab_CD with [ISO 639](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) language codes and [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) country codes, e.g. 'nl_NL' or 'en_US'.

The provided locale changes the language of:

- Payment pages
- Emails sent by MultiSafepay

When no locale is provided or when the language is not supported by MultiSafepay, American English is used by default.

For example, if an email template is set for a German customer, but the locale is received as en_US, the email template will be sent in English and not in German.
