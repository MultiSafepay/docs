## MOTO, What it is

MOTO payments, also known as mail order and telephone order, allow you to accept credit card payments by manually entering the payment details in your payment gateway by means of a virtual terminal.

## MOTO, How it works

MOTO payments are processed from your MultiSafepay control. To process MOTO payments, the Screening department needs to enable this functionality. The MOTO tool can only be used for credit cards, namely Visa, Mastercard and American Express. Credit cards to which a 3D Secure verification is applied, can also be processed with the MOTO tool. However, the 3D Secure protocol is not started. This means that these credit cards, although initially set to go through the 3D Secure verification, skip the verification process when completing the payment.

MOTO payments are processed from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) under _Tools_. The customer provides the credit card details by email or telephone. By selecting a currency and the total amount, the payment that is linked to a webshop can be finalized.

Please note, processing credit card payment through MOTO means skipping the 3D Secure verification and not benefiting from the additional security layer. 
Completed MOTO credit card payments are thus not 3D Secure enrolled. Therefore, the risk of fraud lies entirely with the merchant.
