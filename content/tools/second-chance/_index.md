Second Chance is an email service to remind customers about payments they initiated but didn't complete. The first email is sent 1 hour after the customer initiated the payment, and a second after 24 hours. The emails contain a link to a payment page complete the payment. 

When enabled in your MultiSafepay account, Second Chance emails are sent to customers automatically. This helps increase conversion and boost impulse purchases.

## Activating Second Chance
To activate Second Chance, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Select the website you want to enable the Second Chance for.
3. Under **Website functionality** tile, enable **Second Chance**.

## Customizing Second Chance
Second Chance emails are completely customizable using a Second Chance [email template](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/email-template/body-and-html).

To edit the email template, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. Download the standard Second Chance email and customize it as required.

**Note:** The email template contains a piece of formatted text. For technical support, contact your web developer.

## Requirements

{{< details title="Customer email address" >}}

Second Chance emails can only be sent if the customer's email address is included in the transaction request.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Transaction status" >}}         

Second Chance emails cannot be activated or sent to the customer while the status of the original transaction is **Uncleared**, or once it is **Completed**.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Payment methods" >}}

Second Chance emails can't be sent for the following payments methods because they follow a different payment flow:

- [Klarna](/payment-methods/billing-suite/klarna)
- [AfterPay](/payment-methods/billing-suite/afterpay)
- [Betaal per Maand](/payment-methods/billing-suite/betaalpermaand)
- [Pay After Delivery](/payment-methods/billing-suite/pay-after-delivery)
- [Bank transfer](/payment-methods/banks/bank-transfer)
- [Direct Debit](/payment-methods/banks/sepa-direct-debit)

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Customer consent" >}}

Under the [GDPR](/faq/gdpr/), you must obtain documented consent from the customer to send Second Chance emails. 

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Valid payment link" >}}

Payment links in Second Chance emails have the same lifetime as the original payment link, which is set to 30 days by default. 

For more information, see [Adjusting payment link lifetimes](/developer/api/adjusting-payment-link-lifetimes).

## Potential errors

{{< details title="External plugins" >}}

Second Chance emails can create conflicts with external warehouse systems. In some cases, this can be resolved using a [cron job](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#cron). However, this is not always a stable solution. 

For example, when a customer cancels an order in the webshop, they can still pay for it using Second Chance within 30 days or a specified time frame. For more information, see [Adjusting payment link lifetimes](/developer/api/adjusting-payment-link-lifetimes/). 

If a cancelled order is subsequently paid for, MultiSafepay reopens the order in the webshop. A warehouse system may have already released the reservation on the order when it received **Cancelled** status, or may consider the **Cancelled** status permanent. As result, the items the customer ordered may no longer be available or in stock.

Second Chance emails can cause issues when running an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
