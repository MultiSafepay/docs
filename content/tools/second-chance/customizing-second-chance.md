Second Chance emails are completely customizable using a Second Chance [email template](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/email-template/body-and-html).

To edit the email template, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. Download the standard Second Chance email and customize it as required.

**Note:** The email template contains a piece of formatted text. For technical support, contact your web developer.
