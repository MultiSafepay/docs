Second Chance is an email service to remind customers about payments they initiated but didn't complete. The first email is sent 1 hour after the customer initiated the payment, and a second after 24 hours. The emails contain a link to a payment page complete the payment. 

When enabled in your MultiSafepay Control, Second Chance emails are sent to customers automatically. This helps increase conversion and boost impulse purchases.
