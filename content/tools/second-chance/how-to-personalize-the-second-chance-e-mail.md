You can fully personalize the Second Chance email. This can be done by creating a Second Chance email template. 
In your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/), you will find the email template tool under _Settings_.

Download the standard Second Chance email. You can style the email template entirely to your own taste.

_Please note: There is a piece of formatted text processed in the email template, contact your web developer for technical support_.
