The Second Chance email is an email reminder that points out to your customers of their attempted (and incomplete) payments and encourages them to finalize. This way you can stimulate impulse purchases.

The Second Chance email will automatically be sent to the customer when enabled. Included in these emails, there is a payment link that will allow the customer to complete the payment.
