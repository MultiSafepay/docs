## How is the invoice structured?


The invoice consists of the monthly commission payout and the VAT (21%). Please note; the commission payout has already been paid out and invoice follows one month later together with the VAT.

Your invoice contains the information of the prior month. The date can be found on top of invoice.

* Invoice date: the date you receive the invoice as well as the VAT of prior month.
* Invoice period: the month of the commission payout.

When a withdrawal takes place from the account balance to the business account, a fee of â‚¬ 0.50 will be subtracted for every withdrawal. This is visible on the invoice overview.
The monthly commission payout is the amount to receive, seperate from the VAT.
On the bottom of the invoice you can find the date the VAT is refunded into your account.

The invoice is for administrative purposes only. You do not need to settle the amount separately.
