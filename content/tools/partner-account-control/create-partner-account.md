## MultiSafepay Partner Account Control

If you would like to create a MultiSafepay Partner Account, we invite you to follow the instructions below:

__Step 1:__ Open the following page: [Signup with MultiSafepay]( https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup?partner)

__Step 2:__ When logging into your account for the first time, a red button will be visible ‘Go to activation’  indicating that important documentation must be uploaded in order to proceed. This documentation is legally required for verification purposes related to your company and the Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBO). 

Please kindly upload the following documents and follow the payment instruction in the last step:

*	Copy of a certified Chamber of Commerce extract (not older than six months).

*	Copy of a valid ID of the directors and/or persons with an interest of 25 percent (or more) in the company e.g. via shares, control or profit.

*	A copy of your company’s’ bank statement through your online banking environment including the IBAN and company name. Please note: the company name on your bank statement must be matching the company name on the Chamber of Commerce extract.

*	A payment in the amount of 1 EUR transferred from your business bank account (this procedure can also be initiated in the MultiSafepay Control).
