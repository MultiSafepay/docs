## Sign up new affiliates

Once your account has been approved, It is possible to sign up new affiliates through the Partner Account.

Navigate to column on the left side of the Partner Account and click on _Affiliates_. This will direct you to the Affiliate dashboard.
On the same page in the top right corner, you will find the partner link which can be sent to new affiliates.

The Affiliate dashboard presents and overview of affiliates that are signed up through your Partner Account Control. The dashboard also allows you have a clear presentation of the following affiliate information:

* Account ID
* Name
* Status
* Registration data
* Phone number
* E-mail address
* Model
* Actions
* Screening status

Before a affiliate becomes approved, they will have to undergo a screening from MultiSafepay. More information about this can be read on our [documentation]( https://docs.multisafepay.com/faq/getting-started/account-approval/) page.
