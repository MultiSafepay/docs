Partners can manage commissions at three levels:

- **Partner level**: Set fixed or percentage-based transaction fees for **all** affiliated merchant accounts.
- **Affiliate level**: Set fixed or percentage-based transaction fees for a specific affiliated merchant account. This overrides the partner-level settings.
- **Transaction level**: [Split incoming payments](/tools/split-payments/what-is-split-payments/) between multiple merchant or partner accounts. You can use this feature for both partner and affiliate-level fees.
