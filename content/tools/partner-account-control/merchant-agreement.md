## Merchant agreement

MultiSafepay is a financial institution that is supervised by the Dutch bank. As a [payment service provider](/faq/general/glossary/#payment-service-provider-psp), we offer payment solutions for which costs are charged. 

All MultiSafepay merchants therefore sign a cooperation agreement with general terms and conditions.
