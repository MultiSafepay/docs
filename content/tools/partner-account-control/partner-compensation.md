## Partner compensation payment

Partner compensation can only be paid after the partner account has been fully approved. Before that, you can make full use of the Partner Dashboard and you will receive partner compensation from connected affiliates.

Approval can be carried out by clicking the red button on the Partner Dashboard page saying _‘Go to Activation’_.

It takes an average of 3 working days before the account is fully approved and activated.
