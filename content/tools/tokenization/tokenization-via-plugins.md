We support tokenization in our plugins for:

- [Magento 1](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/magento1)
- [Magento 2](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/magento2)
- [PrestaShop 1.6](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/prestashop-1-6)
- [PrestaShop 1.7](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/prestashop-1-7)
- [Shopware 6](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/shopware6)

Having completed an initial credit card payment, the customer's credit card details are stored as a token. The customer can then complete subsequent payments in one click.

### Requirements
You must:

* Have enabled credit card payments in your MultiSafepay account.
* Use a plugin that supports the tokenization tool.
* Enable recurring payments.

Email requests to enable recurring payments to your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>
