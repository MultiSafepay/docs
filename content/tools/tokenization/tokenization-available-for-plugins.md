## Tokenization, What it is
The tokenization tool available in the selected plugins ensures that the customer can complete the payment as a one click.

Upon completing the first payment with credit card as payment method, the credit card details are stored as a token. This allows the customer to finalize the next payment by only selecting the stored credit card details.

## Tokenization, How it works
The token is a unique number generated by MultiSafepay that refers to the credit card details provided by the customer upon completing the initial transaction. As result, the customer does not need to fill in the credit card payment details a second time to finalize a payment.

The following is required to use the tokenization tool:

* Process credit card payments
* Use a plugin that supports the tokenization tool
* Enable recurring payments.

Submit your request to enable recurring payments at your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

When recurring payments are enabled for your MultiSafepay Control, the token can be received and processed.
