By requesting the credit card details on the webshop, a 'direct' transaction can be created. Customers can finalize a credit card payment without being redirected to a MultiSafepay payment page, resulting in a faster checkout experience and more control for merchants.

## Transaction flow
Transaction flow is the ways a transaction can be processed for each payment method.

* Order status      
Indicates the status of the order independent of the incoming or outgoing payment of the transaction. Example statuses: **Completed**, **Pending**, or **Rejected**. 

* Transaction status       
Indicates the payment status of the transaction, e.g. **Completed**, **Pending**, or **Rejected**. Once the transaction status is **Completed**, the amount of the transaction is added to your MultiSafepay balance.

All credit card transactions pass through our fraud filter.

###  Credit card settings for direct credit card 3D Secure payments
3D Secure is a technical standard to enhance security. Credit card transactions which are processed with the 3D Secure protocol require a form of authentication of the customer during the payment process. This is usually done via a password connected to the card.

By default, all card orders are processed with 3D Secure.
