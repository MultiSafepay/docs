## 3D enabled request
To process a direct credit card transaction (server to server), use the _POST -/orders_ endpoint. 

The transaction request type should be "direct".    

```shell 
"type": "direct",
"gateway": "CREDITCARD",
```

When 3D secure verification is required, the HTML form will be returned and should be rendered.

```shell 
"customer_verification": {
     "html": "<html>\n<head>\n<title>3D Html form</title>....",
     "type": "form" 
}
```

Once the customer has successfully processed the verification step to finalize the payment, the <i>notification_url</i> will notify the ecommerce platform with a completed status. Order details can be called through a GET -/orders/{order_id} . 

## Non 3D request 
When no 3D verification is required, the transaction status response will be processed directly and no form will be sent.

```shell 

    "success": true,
    "data": {
```

## POST notification
Optionally, POST notification can be enabled, meaning that the transaction status is automatically sent to the notification_url via a POST call. 

By default this parameter is 'GET'.      

```shell 
"payment_options": {
    {
        "notification_url": "https://my.notificatio.url",
        "notification_method" : "POST",
        "cancel_url": null,
        "redirect_url": null,
    }
```
