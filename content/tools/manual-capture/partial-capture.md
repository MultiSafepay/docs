**What is an example of a Partial Capture?**

This type of capture occurs when a customer places an order for multiple items and the merchant is unable to fulfill the complete order in one shipment.
In this case, the goods are delivered out in separate shipments. An authorization is made for the transaction in full and the funds are only cleared for each separate shipment as they happen over a period of time.
