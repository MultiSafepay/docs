## Reconciliation 2.0 for Exact Online

dealer4dealerâ€™s new app Reconciliation 2.0 reconciles sales from your webshop in the Exact Online administration tool with payments received via MultiSafepay. This saves time and increases accuracy.

The app automatically retrieves the details of all payments for the day from MultiSafepay. It then matches each payment to the corresponding open item in Exact Online.
