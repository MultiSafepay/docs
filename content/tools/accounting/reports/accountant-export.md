The Accountant export lists all successful incoming and outgoing transactions, including the amount, payment method, and transaction status (at the time the report was generated).

{{< details title="View export formats" >}}
You can generate the report in the following formats:

* CAMT053
* CODA
* CSV
* MT940
* XLS
* XLSX

&nbsp;  
MultiSafepay does not collect funds for PayPal. Therefore, PayPal transactions don't automatically appear in the Accountant export. To include them, in your backend, make sure the financial status for PayPal transactions is set to **Completed**.

## Generating Accountant exports

To generate an Accountant export, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your live [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), or for test reports, your [MultiSafepay test account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Reports** > **Accountant export**.
3. From the **Date selection** dropdown, select the relevant timeframe (last 2 years only), and then click **Apply**.
4. From the **Report type** dropdown, select the relevant export format. 
5. **Group costs in 1 record** toggle:   
    - **Yes**: Show only the total of all MultiSafepay transaction fees for the selected timeframe.
    - **No**: List each MultiSafepay fee below the matching transaction.
6. Click **Generate report**.
