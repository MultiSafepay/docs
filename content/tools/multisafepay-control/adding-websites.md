To add a website to your MultiSafepay Control, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [live](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) or [test](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com) MultiSafepay Control.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Website settings**.
3. Click **Quick add website**.
4. Select a category related to the website.
5. Provide a description. This is displayed on the MultiSafepay payment page and, depending on the payment method, on the customer's bank statement.
6. Add the website's URL. This must be the URL where you receive payments.
7. Provide a [notification URL](/faq/api/how-does-the-notification-url-work) for MultiSafepay to send status updates to.
8. Click **Save**.

You can add an unlimited number of websites to your MultiSafepay Control, but they must all be operated by the same legal company linked to that MultiSafepay account.

To process payments from a website operated by a separate legal entity, you must sign up for an additional MultiSafepay account.
