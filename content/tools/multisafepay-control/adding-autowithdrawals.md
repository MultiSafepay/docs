Auto-withdrawals let you schedule withdrawals on a specific day.

**Note:** To schedule auto-withdrawals for different currencies, you must have a MultiSafepay balance and an active bank account for each currency.

To add a new auto-withdrawal, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com). 
2. Go to **Finance** > **Payouts**.
3. Under **Automatic withdrawals**, click **+ Add**.
4. In the **Automatic withdrawals** window:
    - Under **Select days**, select a specific day of the week, or the end of the month. 
    - From the **Select currency** dropdown, select the currency. 
    - If you want to schedule withdrawals only when your balance exceeds a specified amount, in the **Withdraw when balance exceeds** fields, enter the amount. 
    - If you want to specify a minimum amount to retain in your balance, in the **Reserve amount** fields, enter an amount.
    - From the **Select the account number** dropdown, select the business bank account number you want to transfer the withdrawal to.
5. Click **Schedule payments**.
