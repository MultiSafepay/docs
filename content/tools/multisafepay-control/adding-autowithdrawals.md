Auto-withdrawals let you add fund withdrawal profiles in other currencies. 

You must have a MultiSafepay balance and an active bank account for each currency.

To add a new auto-withdrawal, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com). 
2. Click the **Withdraw funds** button on the right side of the page.
3. Under **Automatic withdrawals**, click **Add new**.

A new withdraw option appears in the scheduler. You can select Saturday, Sunday, or the last day of the month.

### Payment reference
The payment reference is adjustable. The default setup is:

- Merchant ID 
- Transaction ID 
- MultiSafepay Payout 
- Merchant ID 
- Date
