To withdraw the balance from your MultiSafepay account and transfer it to your business bank account, your account must be fully activated. To check this:

1. [Sign in](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) to your account.
2. From the left-hand dashboard, select **Pay-out**.
3. If your account is not fully activated, a red bar appears at the top of the screen with a link to the page for uploading the documents required to approve your account.

The Risk Team then checks and approves your account details and the information on your website. Once approved, we will send you an email that your account is fully activated. 

Note that you can process customer payments immediately after creating a MultiSafepay account account and implementing your website. But your funds will be held in your MultiSafepay account account until it is fully activated.

You can choose to pay out your MultiSafepay account balance manually or automatically.
