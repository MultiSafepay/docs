The auto-withdrawal feature allows you to add fund withdrawal profiles in other currencies. It must be noted that you must hold a balance and an active bank account for each currency.

This can be accessed by navigating to your Dashboard in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com). Click on _Withdraw funds_ on the right hand side of the page and select _Add new_ under Automatic withdrawals.

A new withdraw option has been added to the scheduler whereby Saturday, Sunday and the last day of the month can be selected.

### Payment reference
The payment reference is adjustable. 
By default the setup for payment reference is:

* Merchant ID 
* Transaction ID 
* MultiSafepay Payout 
* Merchant ID 
* Date
