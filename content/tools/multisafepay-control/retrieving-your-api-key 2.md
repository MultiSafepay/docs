To retrieve your API key for a specific website, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [live](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) or [test](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com) MultiSafepay Control.

2. Go to **Settings** > **Website settings**.

3. Click on the website to view the: 

    - API key
    - Site ID
    - Secure Code

To connect the website to the MultiSafepay platform:

Most [ecommerce integrations](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations) supported by MultiSafepay request an API key, site ID, secure code, and account ID. Your account ID appears in the top right corner of the MultiSafepay Control banner. If you are building your own integration using our API, SDK, or wrapper, use the API key under your website settings.

1. Enter the required details in the backend of your website.

2. The connection is finalized.

3. [Place a test order](https://docs.multisafepay.com/api/#orders) using our API to validate the connection.
