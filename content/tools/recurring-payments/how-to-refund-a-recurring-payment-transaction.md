A recurring transaction can only be refunded to the customer when the financial status of the transaction is marked as _completed_. The refund can be processed as follows:

1. Select _Transaction -> Transaction overview_ in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)
2. Find the transaction through search
3. Open transaction
4. Select _Refund_
5. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer
6. _Confirm_ the refund.

_By default, MultiSafepay does not allow you to refund more than the stated amount of the original transaction. Please check your eligibility for being able to refund more with your MultiSafepay account manager._

The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day.
