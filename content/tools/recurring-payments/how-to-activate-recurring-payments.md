Recurring payments are not included by default in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)


A request to activate recurring payments can be sent to either your account manager or to our Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com>

There is a fixed limit to the amount of recurring payments you may charge per recurring ID. By default, this can be done once every 24 hours.

If you want to charge multiple transactions on a single recurring ID on the same day, contact our Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com> to substantiate your argument on why you want this.
