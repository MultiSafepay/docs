The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an information security standard mandated by major card schemes that applies to organizations which handle branded credit cards. The standard is administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.

MultiSafepay is fully PCI DSS certified.

## Testing security
In accordance with our [PCI DSS](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-pcidss/) certification and other obligations, we regularly perform security checks on our system. This includes penetration tests, which are a form of ethical hacking that simulate a cyberattack in order to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
