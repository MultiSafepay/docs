To help combat financial and data fraud, the [PSD2](/payment-regulations/psd2/) requires strong customer authentication (SCA) for most online payments in Europe.

If transactions aren't appropriately authenticated, banks may have to decline them. 

## Exemptions

MultiSafepay supports the following exemptions (on request):

- Low value payments (LVP), i.e. under 30 EUR
- Payments subject to transaction risk analysis (TRA)

This can help you optimize [conversion](/getting-started/glossary/#conversion-rate) and minimize risk.

To apply, email your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>
