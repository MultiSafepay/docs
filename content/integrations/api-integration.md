This tutorial explains how to build your own integration using our API, and how to create orders and track their progress via our webhook.

# Prerequisites

You must first:

1. [Create a test account](/docs/getting-started-guide#1-create-a-free-test-account).
2. [Set up your account](/docs/getting-started-guide#2-set-up-your-account).
3. [Get your site API key](/docs/sites#site-id-api-key-and-security-code).


To authenticate requests, you must include your API key as a query parameter in the request URL.  

&nbsp; **üí° Tip!** While building your integration we recommend using the [test environment](/reference/environments/): `https://testapi.multisafepay.com/v1/json`.

Before continuing with this tutorial, see if you can save development time with our range of [wrappers and SDKs](/docs/wrappers-sdks/).

# 1. Create an order

MultiSafepay provides a RESTful API you can access with HTTP requests to manage your data. We support data in JSON format only.

The most important data element in our API is the <<glossary:order>>, which can be linked to multiple <<glossary:transactions>>. 

**1.** Test the most common operation with our API which is to [create an order](/reference/createorder/). To specify which payment flow the customer experiences, set the order `type` to <<glossary:direct>> or <<glossary:redirect>>.

#### Example request
This is an example request for a <<glossary:redirect>> order.

``` javascript
curl -X POST "https://testapi.multisafepay.com/v1/json/orders?api_key={your-test-api-key}" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-d '{
  "type": "redirect",
  "order_id": "my-order-id-1",
  "gateway": "",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "amount": 1000,
  "description": "Test order description",
  "payment_options": {
    "notification_url": "https://www.example.com/client/notification?type=notification",
    "notification_method": "POST",
    "redirect_url": "https://www.example.com/client/notification?type=redirect",
    "cancel_url": "https://www.example.com/client/notification?type=cancel",
    "close_window": true
  },
  "customer": {
    "locale": "nl_NL",
    "ip_address": "123.123.123.123",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "company_name": "Test Company Name",
    "address1": "Kraanspoor",
    "house_number": "39C",
    "zip_code": "1033SC",
    "city": "Amsterdam",
    "country": "NL",
    "phone": "0208500500",
    "email": "jdoe@example.com",
    "referrer": "https://example.com",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/38.0.2125.111 Safari/537.36"
  }
}'
```

**2.** Check that you receive a response with `success` set to `true`.

#### Example response
``` javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "order_id": "my-order-id-1",
    "payment_url": "https://example.com/?lang=nl_NL"
  }
}
```

**3.** Open the `payment_url` to complete payment on the payment page. 

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** If you receive an error in the response, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/).

‚úÖ **Success!** You have successfully created an order. Now learn how to track orders via our webhook as they progress.

# 2. Set up webhook

The most important parameters in the <<glossary:order>> are `status`(the <<glossary:order status>>) and `financial_status` (the <<glossary:transaction status>>).

To understand how orders are progressing, we recommend tracking their `status`. So that you don't have to continually poll our server to check for updates to your orders, we provide a webhook to send you notifications automatically. 

To learn how to configure your webhook endpoint and handle notifications, see [Webhook](/docs/webhook/).

For information about all possible statuses, see [Payment statuses](/docs/payment-statuses/).

‚úÖ **Success!** You have configured your webhook endpoint. Now you can test your selected payment methods.

# 3. Test payment methods

For how to test each payment method, see Testing payment methods - [Test payment details](/docs/testing#test-payment-details). 
If this is your first time, we recommend following the steps for [iDEAL](/docs/testing#ideal).

‚úÖ **Success!** You can successfully create orders for your payment mix. 

# GET requests

To fetch information about a specific order, make a [Get order](/reference/getorder/) request, using the `order_id`.
