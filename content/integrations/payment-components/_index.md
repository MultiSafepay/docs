Payment components are building blocks for embedding payment methods directly into your checkout page that:

- Provide a seamless checkout experience to increase conversion.
- Encrypt customer payment details for secure processing.
- Shift responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) to MultiSafepay.

### Example

{{< screen src="/gifs/credit-card-component.gif" alt="Credit card component" align="center" class="medium-img" screen_size="desktop" >}}

## Integration

Integrate a payment component for:

- [Multiple payment methods](/integrations/payment-components/integrating-multiple-payment-methods/)
- [A single payment method](/integrations/payment-components/integrating-single-payment-method/)

## Customization

You can customize the look of the payment component to match your brand's visual identity, and set the display language.

For instructions, see [Customizing payment components](/integrations/payment-components/customizing-payment-components/).
