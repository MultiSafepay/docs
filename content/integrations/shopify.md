:warning: **Urgent action required:** [Migrate to our updated app](#installation) before March 31, 2022.

This technical manual is for installing/migrating to MultiSafepay's free app for integrating with Shopify. This new app leverages a single, powerful gateway for a faster, safer integration.

<details id="requirements">
<summary>Requirements</summary>
<br>

You will need a [MultiSafepay account](/getting-started/).

</details>

# How to install

To install or migrate, follow these steps:

1. For increased security and stability, wait for off-peak hours and temporarily enable password protection for your webshop.
2. From the [Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/), install the [MultiSafepay Payments app](https://apps.shopify.com/multisafepay-payments).  
3. Check that the app is successfully added under **Admin** > **Settings** > **Payments** > **Alternative payment methods**.
4. In your Shopify checkout, test the **MultiSafepay Payments** gateway.  
  **Note:** If using a test [API key](/websites/#site-id-api-key-and-secure-code), make sure you also enable **Test mode**. 
5. For existing merchants, you must disable the deprecated individual MultiSafepay payment method gateways under **Admin** > **Settings** > **Payments** > **Third-party payment providers**.
6. Once testing is complete, disable password protection again.

# User guide

## Abandoned checkouts

MultiSafepay's [Second Chance](/second-chance/) feature is **not** supported because Shopify offers a similar native service.

See Shopify â€“ [Recovering abandoned checkouts](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/abandoned-checkouts).

## Cancelling payments

If a customer cancels a payment to use another payment method instead, they must complete payment within **2 hours** to avoid errors.

## Countries

The app is unavailable in Norway and Finland. 

For more information, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

## Currencies

Payments are processed in the webshop's default currency only.

## Deprecated version
