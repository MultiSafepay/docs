# User guide

## API keys and environments

You can change your [site API key](/docs/sites/#site-id-api-key-and-security-code) or environment (live or test) after installation.

<details id="how-to-change-api-keys-and-environments">
<summary>How to change API keys and environments</summary>
<br>

1. Sign in to the app.
2. Tap the hamburger menu and go to **Environment**.
3. Edit your **API key** and/or the **Environment**.

</details>

## Checkouts

This app is tested using the default 1-step and 1-page checkout using the default theme.

<details id="how-to-order-payment-methods-in-your-checkout">
<summary>How to order payment methods in your checkout</summary>
<br>

To change the order in which payment methods appear on your checkout page, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Payment method settings**. 
2. Drag and drop the payment methods to the preferred order.
3. Click **Save**.

**How to set the payment method order per language**

To set the payment method order for different languages, under the **Payment method settings** select a country / store language and set the order per language.

If no specific rule is set for a country, the **Default** order is used.

</details>

## Internationalization

<details id="how-to-change-internationalization">
<summary>How to change internationalization</summary>
<br>

When changing internationalization in your Lightspeed eCom backend, do **not** change the primary language setting while installing the app.  

Lightspeed eCom requires a language, an API key, and a cluster to validate API requests. 

If you remove the language used during installation instead of deactivating it, the app cannot communicate with Lightspeed eCom services.

</details>

## Lightspeed shop ID

<details id="how-to-view-your-shop-id">

To view your shop ID, follow these steps:

2. Click **Help** in the bottom-left corner.

**Per payment method**

To set a maximum/minimum order amount for a payment method to display on your checkout page, follow these steps:

1. In the **Payment methods ordering** list, click the **+** button to open the relevant payment method.
2. Enter an amount in EUR cents in the:  
    - **Maximum** field, e.g. A maximum value of 1500 cents means the payment method only appears on the checkout page if the total order amount is **less** then 15 EUR. If you **don't** want a maximum amount, enter **-1**.
    **OR**
    - **Minimum** field, e.g. A minimum value of 1500 cents means the payment method only appears on the checkout page if the total order amount is **more** then 15 EUR.

</details>

<details id="payment-methods-logos-in-your-site-footer">
<summary>Payment methods logos in your site footer</summary>
<br>

By default, the app does **not** support adding payment methods logos to your site footer. We provide a script for this, or you can ask your developer to add the logos to your theme. Themes can differ and you may need to make some changes for it to function.

**How to add logos via our script**

1. Sign in to your Lightspeed app.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Storefront payment icons**.
3. Click **Copy to clipboard**. 
5. In your **Lightspeed admin area**, go to **Settings** > **Web extras and custom Javascript**. 
6. Paste the script into the **Javascript textbox**, and set the status to **Enable**.
7. Click **Save**. The logos appear in the footer.

**Display order**  

Depending on the storefront, the display order of the logos is determined by the settings at the time of generation. If you update these settings, you must update the script as well.

**Size**  

By default the logos are 16 px high. In most themes, footer logos are found in the "div.payment-methods p". If needed, you can change the selector based on the theme.

**How to resize logos**

1. In the JavaScript for displaying the logos, locate the following `img` element near the end of the script:
    ```
    <img src="${msplt[e]}" alt="${e}" />
    ```
2. Specify the height and width in pixels as required, e.g.:
    ```
    <img height="16" width="37" src="${msplt[e]}" alt="${e}" />
    ```

**How to add missing logos**  

Logos may be missing due to your site theme settings. 

To add missing payment method logos, follow these steps:

1. Download the logos from our [Github repo](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/MultiSafepay-icons).
2. Rename the file with upper case formatting, e.g applepay.png > APPLEPAY.png.
3. Sign in to your Lightspeed app.
4. Go to **Design** > **Theme editor** > **Advanced** > **Edit code** > **Assets**, and drop in the logos.  

The logos won't appear instantly. It takes a little time.

**JavaScript**

For the best user experience, we provide some Javascript and images, e.g. to add a dropdown for iDEAL and MultiSafepay icons for other payment methods. 

Some user-added themes or scripts may cause issues, e.g. missing images for payment methods. 

For assistance, ask your developer. 

All payment methods still work if you don't use the Javascript files.

<details id="how-to-disable-payment-methods">
<summary>How to disable payment methods</summary>

To disable payment methods for specific languages, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Lightspeed app.
2. Select the relevant storefont.
4. For each language, disable the relevant payment methods. 

If no specific language rule-set is found, **Default** is used.

**Missing payment methods**

By default, newly activated payment methods for your MultiSafepay account are disabled in the Lightspeed app's MultiSafepay payments settings. You need to enable them in both environments.

If a payment method is missing:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) and check that the payment method is enabled.
2. Sign in to your Lightspeed app, go to **Settings**, and then enable the payment method again. 

</details>

2. Go to **Apps** > **Purchased apps** > **MultiSafepay payments**.
3. Click **Go to app**.
4. Sign in to the MultiSafepay app.

</details>

## Payment reminders

The Lightspeed app doesn't support [Second Chance](/docs/second-chance/) emails because Lightspeed orders expire after 12 hours. 

Lightspeed offers a functionality that lets you configure payment reminders and emails for orders with **Pending** status. For more information and instructions, see Lightspeed – [Configuring payment reminders](https://ecom-support.lightspeedhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/220661507-Configuring-payment-reminders).

## Refunds

[Full and partial refunds](/docs/refund-payments/) and credit notes are supported in your MultiSafepay dashboard and backend.  
You can't refund more than the original amount in your backend.

<details id="how-to-enable-refunds-in-your-backend">
<summary>How to enable refunds in your backend</summary>
<br>

1. Sign in to your Lightspeed app.
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. In the sidebar, click **Enable refunds**.
4. Select the relevant setting:
    - Refunds disabled (default)
    - Refunds enabled:
        - Create a refund when the credit memo status is **Unpaid** (default when refunds are enabled).
        - Always create a refund, no matter the credit memo status.

**Notes**

- If you use Lightspeed eCom linked to [Lightspeed Retail](https://www.lightspeedhq.nl/kassasysteem/retail/) to process refunds via MultiSafepay, you must enable the **Always create a refund, no matter the status** setting.

- When creating a credit memo, set the status to **Not paid**. If the **Always create a refund, no matter the status** setting is not enabled, MultiSafepay ignores **Paid** status.

</details>

<details id="known-issues">
<summary>Known issues</summary>
<br>

- For refunds created in your Lightspeed backend, a short message appears in the **Notes** section of the order where any errors are explained.
- Refunds created in your MultiSafepay dashboard are not reported back to Lightspeed. Under **Offline actions**, an error appears: "Already a completed transaction".
- Some <<glossary:BNPL>> orders:
    - Require product IDs for each refunded item. When using product variants, make sure each variant has a unique identifier. If you provide duplicate IDs, we cannot distinguish which items to refund.
    - Do not let you refund a partial amount and a full item in a single request, e.g. a shopping cart contains 3 items for a total of 1.70 EUR. If you refund 1 item and 0.40 EUR, it fails. Make sure you refund items and amounts separately.
- You cannot issue multiple refunds for the same amount within 5 minutes of each other, even for different items. 

</details>

## Single sign-on

Lightspeed single sign-on lets you sign in to the app's **Settings** directly from the Lightspeed eCom store. You don't need to click or tap the **Login** button.

<details id="how-to-use-lightspeed-single-sign-on">

<br>

1. Sign in to the **Admin** section of your Lightspeed store.
2. In the sidebar, click **Apps**.
3. Click **Purchased apps**.

<summary>How to apply surcharges</summary>
<br>

1. Sign in to your Lightspeed app.
2. Go to **App** > **Purchased app** > **MultiSafepay app**.
