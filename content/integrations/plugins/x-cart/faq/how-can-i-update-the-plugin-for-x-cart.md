Generally, there are three ways to update a plugin. This can be done through the backend and through the marketplace from a CMS or through SFTP. However, we will be describing the necessary steps via the backend of X-Cart.

* Make sure you have a backup of your production environment
* Test the plugin in a staging environment.
