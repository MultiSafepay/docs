Generally, there are three ways to update a plugin. This can be done through the backend and through the marketplace from a CMS or through SFTP. We will be describing the necessary steps to update a plugin via SFTP.

Before you update the plugin, we strongly recommend you the following:

1. Make sure you have a backup of your production environment
2. Test the plugin in a staging environment.

Go to our [Manual](/integrations/prestashop-1-6/manual/) page, download the plugin and follow the instructions from step 2.
