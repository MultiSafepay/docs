### Introduction

{{% introduction_plugin "WooCommerce" %}}

### 1. Requirements
- Wordpress 5.0
- PHP 7.2

### 2. Installation
There are two ways in which the plugin for WooCommerce can be downloaded. If your working on a new webshop and would like to retrieve our plugins, you can find them at the [Wordpress plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multisafepay/)

If you already have a webshop with our plugin, please turn on the automatic check for module updates. Go to _Administration_ -> _Preferences_ -> _General_ -> _Automatic check for module updates_. By doing this, the system will give you a suggestion to upgrade.

You can also download the plugin directly on this page:

1. Download the plugin by clicking the Download button in this [page](/integrations/woocommerce/)
2. Navigate to the backend of your webshop and go to _Plugins_ -> _Add New_. Click on _Browse file_
3. Upload the Plugin_WooCommerce_x.x.x.zip file.

### 3. Configuration
1. Login in your WooCommerce Admin and navigate to _WooCommerce_ -> _Settings_ -> _Payments_
2. Scroll down to the section _MultiSafepay settings_ and configure the plugin. Information about the API key can be found on our [API key page](/tools/multisafepay-control/get-your-api-key)
3. Navigate to _WooCommerce_ -> _Settings_ -> _Checkout_ -> _Payments_. Enable the payment methods you would like to offer.

### 4. Congratulations
You have installed and configured the plugin successfully. If you have any questions regarding the plugin, feel free to contact our Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
