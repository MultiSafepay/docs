## Shopware 6 Migration

At MultiSafepay, we like to stay up to date with the latest innovative technologies in the ecommerce market and only recently the latest version of Shopware has been released.

Shopware 6 is the latest addition to the ecommerce platform company and offers merchants with an all-new user friendly interface, allowing them to experience new possibilities that foster business needs. The new version still holds its simplicity, as well as new features that do not hinder the functionality. This includes:

* An all-new Sales Channels function linking Shopware 6 to social shopping platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. In addition, this functionality also supports mobile apps and POS systems
* A Rule Builder enabling price rules per country and multi-currency options. This also includes VAT rules per country and delivery options such as the cost and delivery time based on a set of rules e.g. free delivery above a specified amount
* A function allowing content management through the use of stylized blocks at Experience and Storytelling pages
* Text editing which has now become more user-friendly and easier to edit
