In Magento 2, it is mandatory to _ship_ goods in order to be paid. In Magento 2, you are able to click on _Ship_ on the _Order_ page itself. It is then possible to fill in the shipping information. Proceed by clicking _Submit_ and the following messages will appear:

_The order status has successfully been updated at MultiSafepay_
_The Shipment has been created_

When goods are shipped, the following information will be sent: track-and-trace code, carrier and shipping date.
