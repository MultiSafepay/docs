Currently we test our plugin at two Magento 2 checkouts:  

* Magento 2 core checkout  
* [MagePlaza OneStepCheckout](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-one-step-checkout-extension)

>_Most Magento checkout plugins are compatible with our plugin. However, we can not guarantee the proper functioning of all features within the checkout plugin_.
