The lifetime of orders marked as pending payments in Magento 2 is determined by the _Order Cron Settings configuration_. The default value is set to 480 minutes (8 hours)

When you offer payment methods whose validation period is more than 8 hours, the order in Magento 2 will automatically be marked as _cancelled_ due to the default setting in Magento 2.

In use with an ERP system, for example, where an order is marked as declined, a successful payment will often not be processed to an order that is marked as cancelled.

The lifetime of a [bank transfer](/payment-methods/bank-transfer/how-does-bank-transfer-work/) is 86400 minutes (60 days).

The order will set to _cancelled_ in Magento 2 before a payment can be linked.

To set pending payments order lifetime, see the [Magento Documentation page](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/sales/order-pending-payment-lifetime.html)
