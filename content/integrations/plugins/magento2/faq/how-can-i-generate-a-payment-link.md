From version 2.0 and higher, payment links are automatically generated for every order with a MultiSafepay payment method. Please follow these instructions:

1. Create an order as per usual under _Sales_ --> _Orders_ --> _Create New Order_
2. Once the order has been created, go back to the _Orders overview_ and select the order you just created
3. Click on the order and go to _Comments History_
4. The payment link will be displayed under _Notes for this Order_
5. You can then copy and paste the link and send it to the customer.
