Yes, it is possible to refund orders or credit memo from within the Magento 2 backend.  
You can also refund from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)

Refunding from the Magento 2 backend is disabled when the order has a Fooman Surcharge. It is still possible to refund those orders through [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
