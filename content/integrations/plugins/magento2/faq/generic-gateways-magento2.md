The Magento 2 plugin offers a generic gateway. This is a gateway which you can customize yourself.
It can be found when you navigate to the MultiSafepay payment methods inside the MultiSafepay configuration:

 _Stores_ -> _Configuration_ -> _MultiSafepay_ -> _Payment Methods_ -> _Generic Gateway_

You enter the gateway code and upload a custom gateway image.
You also need to set if the gateway requires a shopping cart or not.
It works for the most part like a regular redirect payment method.
Except for recurring payments, all the features like refunding and creating a backend order are supported.

If you have any questions regarding the integration of the generic gateway, please contact our integration team at integration@multisafepay.com
