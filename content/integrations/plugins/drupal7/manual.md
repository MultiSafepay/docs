## Introduction

{{% introduction_plugin "Drupal 7" %}}

## 1. Requirements
- Drupal 7.x
- Tested on PHP 7.0

## 2. Installation
 1. Unpack the content of the .ZIP file in the root of your webshop.

## 3. Configuration
1. Login into your backend and navigate to _Site Settings_ -> _Modules_. Enable the Commerce MultiSafepay JSON module, along with the payment method modules of your choice. Then click _Save configuration_ to save the changes you have made

2. In the backend of your webshop, navigate to _Store Settings -> Advanced Store Settings -> Payment methods_.
_Enable_ first the MultiSafepay core module ("multisafepay") and then _Enable_ the modules for each payment method.
Click the button _Edit_ under _Actions_ to configure the payment method

3. When the main module is installed, two rules are created by default, but left disabled:  
  * MultiSafepay Order paid in full: Order state to processing  
This rule will set the order to processing once the order has been paid in full  

  * MultiSafepay Order Complete: Shipped at MultiSafepay  
This rule will update the transaction order status to _shipped_ at MultiSafepay, causing the invoicing process to continue for Pay After Delivery, Klarna and E-invoicing.

## 4. Congratulations
You have installed and configured the plugin successfully. If you have any questions regarding the plugin, feel free to contact our Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
