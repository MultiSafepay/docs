1. Read the page [How do I get tokenization?](/tools/tokenization/how-do-i-get-tokenization/)
2. Enable Tokenization via _Stores->Configuration->MultiSafepay->MultiSafepay Settings_.

Note: 
The Tokenization feature is not available for the Credit Card gateway. 
You are required to enable the Visa, Mastercard and/or Maestro gateways separately in order to have this feature. This will make the _"Save Card"_ option available during the checkout process.
