2. Go to the order in the Magento backend for which youâ€™d like to issue a refund
3. Click the _Invoices_ tab on the left of the _Order Overview_
4. Open the invoice, and click on _Credit memo_ located at the top right of the overview
5. Once the desired refunds/adjustments have been provided and made, click on _Refund Online_ so we can receive the request.

> Issuing a refund for AfterPay, Klarna, Pay After Delivery, Betaal per Maand or E-Invoicing in the Magento 1 ecommerce platform is possible. However, this can only be processed by selecting an item. It is not possible to credit an amount from the Magento 1 backend.

**Warning: If an amount is specified instead of an item selected, the entire order will be refunded.**
