MultiSafepay processes payments in Euros (EUR) as a standard [currency](/faq/general/which-currencies-are-supported-by-multisafepay)
Our Magento 1 plugin is developed based on this.

However, if your webshop uses a different currency, simply change the configuration in the plugin settings:

_System_ -> _Configuration_ -> _MultiSafepay x.x.x_ -> _Connect Settings_ -> _Allow currency conversion to Euro_ -> _No_.
