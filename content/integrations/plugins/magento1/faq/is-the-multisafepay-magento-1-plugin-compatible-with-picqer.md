Yes, but you will have to follow two additional steps, because orders should not go to the Cancel state.

1. Go the the MultiSafepay Connect settings in you Magento 1 backend and link the status expired to Waiting
2. Open "app\code\community\MultiSafepay\Msp\Model\Base.php", copy the file to the local folder in the Magento structure
3. Find the line $order->cancel(); at the expired signal and remove it.

Now all the expired orders will keep the waiting status until you cancel them. You can do this by hand, schedule it with a custom cronjob or by using a plugin.
