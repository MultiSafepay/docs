Adding a payment fee is not automatically supported within the Prestashop plugin.

See how applying payment fees or surcharges for your customers may affect your webshop on our [PSD2 documentation page](/faq/psd2)

Of course we do our best to support and assist you. However, when we investigate or reproduce on the core of a plugin, we cannot guarantee perfect compatibility when installing an external package.
