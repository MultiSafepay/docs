To add a payment fee is not automatically supported within the plugin of Prestashop.

However, an external package of [BVK](https://www.bvkyazilim.com/cart/prestashop-modules) is available. This allows you to still add a payment fee within the desired payment method.

>_Do mind that because an external module has to be installed, our technical support is limited_.

See how applying payment fees or surcharges for your customers may affect your webshop on our [PSD2 documentation page](/faq/psd2/)

Of course we do our best to support and assist you. However, when we investigate or reproduce on the core of a plugin, we cannot guarantee perfect compatibility when installing an external package.
