Generally, there are three ways to update a plugin. This can be done through the backend and through the marketplace from a CMS or through SFTP. However, we will be describing the necessary steps via the backend of VirtueMart.

Before you update the plugin, we strongly recommend you the following:

* Make sure you have a backup of your production environment
* Test the plugin in a staging environment.

Go to our [Manual](/integrations/virtuemart/manual) page, download the plugin and follow the instructions from step 2.
