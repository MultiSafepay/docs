The OpenCart plugin offers a generic gateway. The generic gateway can be found on the plugin settings page, listed in the payment methods tab.

All of our payment methods are supported. It is possible to set the gateway code, gateway logo, gateway label, and whether the shopping cart should be included in refund transactions. Specifying whether the shopping cart should be included in refund transactions is required if the gateway code used is that of a billing suite payment method.

In the same way than others gateways, is possible also filter the generic gateway by geo zone, currency, min amount, max amount, customer groups, and a set a custom initial order status.

Full refunding actions and backend orders are fully supported.
