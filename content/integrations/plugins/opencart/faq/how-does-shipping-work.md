In the OpenCart plugin, it is mandatory to _ship_ goods in order to be paid. The plugin allows you to click on a button in the _Order details_ section of an order and set the order to _Shipped_.

By default, OpenCart does not save any reference of an order such as a track-and-trace number. Furthermore, MultiSafepay will receive the date of shipment of an order.
