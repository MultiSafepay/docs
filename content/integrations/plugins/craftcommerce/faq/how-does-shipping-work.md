In the Craft Commmerce plugin, it is mandatory to _ship_ goods in order to be paid. 

_Shipping_ works by setting custom order statuses, since Craft Commerce does not have order statuses by default. Once you have created order statuses, you may navigate to the _Craft admin panel_ -> _MultiSafepay settings_. In this section, you can select which order status should trigger the shipment of an order.

Once an order has been shipped, a notification will be sent out.
