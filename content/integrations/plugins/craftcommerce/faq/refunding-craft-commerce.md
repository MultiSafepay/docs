Yes, it is possible to refund orders from within the Craft Commerce admin panel.  

In the Craft CMS admin panel, navigate to _Commerce_ -> _Orders_ and select an order.
Navigate to the _Transactions_ tab and there you see the refund options.

It is not possible to refund orders that are paid with billing suite payment methods from the Craft CMS admin panel. 

You can also refund from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
