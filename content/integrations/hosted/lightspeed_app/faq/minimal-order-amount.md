Yes, you can change the minimum order amount for a payment method to be displayed to the customer. To do so, you have to open the payment method in the _Payment methods ordering_ list by clicking on the "+" sign and then entering an amount in EUR cents.

_For example, if you input a minimal value of 1500 for iDEAL, it means that iDEAL will not be displayed in the checkout unless the total order amount equals 15,00 EUR or more._

If you want different minimum order amounts for different languages you can configure this as well. In the drop-down menu under the _Payment methods ordering_ header, you can select a country and make a change on a per language basis.
_Default_ is used if no specific ruleset for a language is specified.
