Yes, you can change the maximum order amount for a payment method to be shown in the checkout. To do so, please follow these instructions:

1. Open the desired payment method in the _Payment methods ordering_ list by clicking on the "+" sign
2. Enter an amount in EUR cents in the maximum field. If you do not want a maximum amount, enter “-1”.

_For example, iDEAL with a maximum value of 1500 means that iDEAL will not be displayed in the checkout unless the total order amount is less then 15,00 EUR._

If you want different maximum order amounts for different languages, you can configure this in the dropdown menu under the _Payment methods ordering_ header where you need to select a country and make a change on a per language basis.
_Default_ is used if no specific ruleset for a language is set up.
