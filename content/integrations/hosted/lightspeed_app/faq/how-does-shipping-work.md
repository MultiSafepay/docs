In Lightspeed, it is mandatory to _ship_ goods in order to be paid..

In the backend of Lightspeed, orders are marked with the status _Klaar voor verzending_. If you click on _Markeren als verzonden_, MultiSafepay will be notified that the order has been shipped.

When clicking on a shipment, a pop up will appear where a track-and-trace code can be issued. It is not possible for orders to be _un-shipped_.
