Payment method logos may be missing due to a theme that is causing them to not appear on your Lightspeed website. This can easily be fixed by following these instructions:

1. Download the logo(s) from our [Github repo](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/MultiSafepay-icons)
2. Rename the file with upper case formatting e.g applepay.png → APPLEPAY.png
3. Place the image file in _Design_ → _Theme editor_ → _Advanced_ → _Edit code_ → _Assets_  

_Please note that changes will not occur instantly and may take time to come into effect._
