Within Lightspeed, MultiSafepay's [Second Chance]((https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/second-chance/how-does-it-work/)) tool cannot be used, as Lightspeed orders expire after 12 hours. However, similar to Second Chance, Lightspeed offers a functionality that allows you to configure payment reminders for orders which are still _Pending_.

The functionality allows you to enable and configure payment reminders as well as creating payment reminder emails. For more information regarding this option, step-by-step instructions are given on the official website of [Lightspeed](https://ecom-support.lightspeedhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/220661507-Configuring-payment-reminders)
