Similar to [Second Chance](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/second-chance/how-does-it-work/), Lightspeed offers a similar functionality which allows you to configure payment reminders for orders which are still _Pending_.

The functionality allows for you to enable and configure payment reminders as well as creating payment reminder emails. For more information regarding this option, the step-by-step instructions are explained on the official website of [Lightspeed](https://ecom-support.lightspeedhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/220661507-Configuring-payment-reminders)
