In early 2021, we have changed how our login system works for the MultiSafepay Payment app for Lightspeed eCom. Our old system was password based, although now our new system uses the Single Sign On provided by Lightspeed. This means you can directly login via Lightspeed eCom store to our settings page of the app.

To login using the new system you have to use our app store page. Login to the /admin section of your Lightspeed store. 

- Go to apps in de side bar

- Click on the name of our app, MultiSafepay Payments.

- This should open the app store page, Alternatively paste "/admin/store/apps/1517" after the base url of your store. This should bring you to the store page immediately.
- On the store page click on "Go to app" / "Ga naar app" and you will be able to access your settings page.

While a login button is present, this one does not work.
