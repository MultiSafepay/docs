In early 2021, we have changed the login method for the MultiSafepay Payment app for Lightspeed eCom. The old login method was password-based, while the new method uses the single sign-on provided by Lightspeed. This means you can directly log in via the Lightspeed eCom store to our settings page of the app.

To login using the new method you have to use our app store page. Log in to the /admin section of your Lightspeed store. 

- Go to _Apps_ in the side bar

- Click on _Purchased apps_ / _Aangeschafte apps_

- Click on the name of our app, _MultiSafepay Payments_.

- This should open the app store page, alternatively paste "/admin/store/apps/1517" after the base url of your store. This should bring you to the store page immediately.
- On the store page click on "Go to App" / "Ga naar App" and you will be able to access your settings page.

While a login button is present, this one does not work.
