In early 2021 we have changed how our login system works for the MultiSafepay Payment app for lightspeed eCom. Our old system was password based, our new system uses the Single Sign On provided by lightspeed. This means you can directly login from our our settings page on the app page.

To login using the new system you have to use our app store page. Login to the /admin section of your lightspeed store. Go to apps, my apps / "aangeschafte apps" and click on the name of our app, MultiSafepay Payments. This should open the app store page. Alternatively paste "/admin/store/apps/1517" after the base url your store.

On the store page click on "Goto app" / "Ga naar app" And you will be able to access your settings page.
