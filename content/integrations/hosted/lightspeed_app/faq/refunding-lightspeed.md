Yes you can refund orders as well as credit notes. By default you can create a refund in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), however, refunding directly from your Lightspeed backend is possible when cancelling an order.

To allow refunds you first have to enable this setting. Login to [lightspeed.multisafepay.com](https://lightspeed.multisafepay.com/settings), scroll down to "Enable Refunds" or click "Enable refunds" in the sidebar.

If you need any help with refunds, feel free to contact us at <integration@multisafepay.com>
