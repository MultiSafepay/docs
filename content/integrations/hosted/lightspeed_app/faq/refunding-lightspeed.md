There are two ways how to refund an order.
The first is by creating a credit memo or cancelling an order from the Lightspeed backend. By doing so, a refund request is sent to MultiSafepay. If the request proceeds succesfully, the credit memo will show a green dot. This is the recommended method. 

You can also create a refund in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), however, 
refunding directly from your Lightspeed backend is recommended.
