Yes you can refund orders. By default you can create a refund in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), however, refunding directly from your Lightspeed backend is possible.

To allow automatic refunds you first have to enable this setting. Login to [lightspeed.multisafepay.com](https://lightspeed.multisafepay.com/settings), scroll down to "Enable Refunds" or click "Enable refunds" in the sidebar and here you can enable automatic refunds. 

Partial refunds are temporary unavailable. A full refund will however be created when an order is cancelled.

Automatic refunds only work when the setting is activated and when the transaction is know by MultiSafepay.

If you need any help with refunds, feel free to contact us!
