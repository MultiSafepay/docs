Using build in lightspeed payment methods icons will appear in the footer when an payment method is enabled. App do not support this by default.

You can add ask your developer to add the images to your theme or you can add them yourself.

To help you out we have create a script which can automaticly add the icons. Please note that that every theme can be diffent and you may have to make some changes for it to work.

To get the script go to the settings page of our app. Below footer icons you will find a generate script button. This will output a script in the textarea below. Copy this script. 
Goto your lightspeed admin area, Settings, web extras and custom javascript. Paste the scipt into the Javascripts textbox, set status to enable and click safe. Icons should now be visible in the footer.

The generated icons update depending on storefront and are ordered depending on the setting at the time of generation. If you update the setttings you would have to update the script aswell.
