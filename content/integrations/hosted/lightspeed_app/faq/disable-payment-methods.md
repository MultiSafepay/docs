### Disabling payment methods
Yes, if you do not want certain payment methods to be displayed at all, you can disable them in the _Payment methods ordering list_. You will see the disabled payment methods in the Payment methods ordering list with a strikethrough.

If you want different payment methods disabled for different languages, you can make these adjustments in the drop-down menu under the _Payment methods ordering_ header where you first need to select a country and then make changes on a per language basis. _Default_ is used if no specific rule-set for a language is found.

### Missing payment methods

Are you missing any payment methods? Please ensure that the payment methods are first enabled in the [MultiSafepay Control](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/multisafepay-control) and then go to the _Settings_ page of our Lightspeed app and enable the respective payment method there again. By default, newly activated payment methods in the MultiSafepay Control are disabled in the Lightspeed MultiSafepay payments settings, so you will be required to enable them in both environments.
