Yes, if you do not want certain payment methods to be displayed at all, you can disable them in the payment methods ordering list. You will see the disabled payment methods in the payment methods ordering list with a strikethrough.

If you want different payment methods disabled for different languages, you can make these adjustments in the dropdown menu under the _Payment methods ordering_ header where you first need to select a country and then make change on a per language basis. _Default_ is used if no specific ruleset for a language is found.

Are you missing any payment methods? Make sure that the payment methods are first enabled in the [MultiSafepay Control](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/multisafepay-control/) and then go to the settings page of our Lightspeed app and enable the respective payment method there again. By default newly activated payment methods in the MultiSafepay Control are disabled in the Lightspeed MultiSafepay Payments settings, so you need to enable them in both places.
