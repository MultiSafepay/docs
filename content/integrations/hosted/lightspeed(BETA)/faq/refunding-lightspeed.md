There are two ways to refund an order.
The first is by creating a credit memo or cancelling a order from the lightspeed backend. By doing so a refund request is send to MultiSafepay. If the request proceeded succesfully the credit memo will show a green dot. This is the prefferd way.

You can also refund from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), however 
refunding directly from your Lightspeed backend is recommended.
