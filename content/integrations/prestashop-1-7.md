# User guide

## Backend orders

In the previous release, PrestaShop backend orders were only created for MultiSafepay orders with **Completed** status. 
In the current release, a backend order is created for **every** order attempt, that is for MultiSafepay orders with **Initialized** status.

## Checkouts

The plugin supports the PrestaShop core checkout and is compatible with most premium themes, unless you have a custom checkout.

<details id="supported-third-party-modules">
<summary>Supported third-party modules</summary>
<br>

The following third-party modules are supported:

- <a href="https://addons.prestashop.com/en/express-checkout-process/8503-one-page-checkout-ps-easy-fast-intuitive.html" target="_blank">One Page Checkout PS</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>
- <a href="https://addons.prestashop.com/en/express-checkout-process/42005-the-checkout.html" target="_blank">The Checkout</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> – Payment options must be set on separate pages in the plugin settings page.

The Integration Team will do their best to provide support for third-party plugins and premium themes. Email <integration@multisafepay.com>

</details>

## Generic gateways

The plugin supports generic gateways, which allows you to add a payment method manually. This is particularly useful for integrating gift cards specific to your business. 

Supported since release: 5.0.0-RC-1, Oct 27th 2021.

<details id="how-to-configure-generic-gateways">
<summary>How to configure generic gateways</summary>
<br>

2. Go to **MultiSafepay** > **Payment methods** > **Generic gateway**.
3. Set the relevant [payment method gateway IDs](/reference/gateway-ids/) and the gateway icon.

You can filter payment methods by:

- Country
- Currency
- Customer group
- Minimum and maximum amount

</details>

## Order flows

The plugin supports two flows for creating orders: **before** or **after** the transaction is completed.

<details id="before-flow">
<summary>Before flow</summary>
<br>

By default, order confirmation emails are sent before the payment is finalized.  
You can disable this feature. 

The status of abandoned payments changes to **Cancelled**.

</details>

<details id="after-flow">
<summary>After flow</summary>
<br>

Orders are created via a MultiSafepay notification to PrestaShop using the `cart ID`. After completing payment, the customer is redirected to your order confirmation page.  
If the notification hasn't been processed yet, a waiting page with a loader displays while the order is created.

</details>
