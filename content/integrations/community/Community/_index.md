At MultiSafepay, our developers code on a daily basis to process in-house transactions. However, there are also many fantastic developers worldwide who code wrappers, plugins, applications and other various code in order to work with us.

We are happy to accompany you starting with a place on our documentation page as well as assist you on marketing level. If you would like for your project to appear on our site, please contact the MultiSafepay Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

We would like to outline the main requirements that community hosters should adhere to if they wish to be a part of the MultiSafepay community.
 These agreements are the following:

* The UA code should be visible and provided on the page (in JSON) and further include the configuration of the plugin and the usage.
* The readme should indicate that full responsibility lies with the developer of the community plugin. This includes customer support and maintenance of the code. It should also indicate that the plugin was not created by MultiSafepay.
* If MultiSafepay decides to add the community plugin as one of the supported plugins by MultiSafepay, we will have the authority to also remove the community plugin without the breach of contract.
* It is required for the community plugin to have shipping updates. A support tab would be ideal to have, but is not compulsory.
* If you have any further questions about being part of the community plugin team, feel free to contact <integration@multisafepay.com>

Once the plugin has been approved, we will happily promote it.
