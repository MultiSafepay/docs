At MultiSafepay, our developers code on a daily basis to process in-house transactions. However, there are also many fantastic developers worldwide who code wrappers, plugins, applications and other various code in order to work with us.

We are happy to accompany you starting with a place on our documentation page as well as assist you on marketing level. If you would like for your project to appear on our documentation page, please contact the MultiSafepay Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

We would like to outline the main requirements that community hosters should adhere to if they wish to be a part of the MultiSafepay community.
 These agreements are the following:

* The [integration information](https://docs.multisafepay.com/api/#plugin-information) should be visible and provided on the page (in JSON) and further include the configuration of the integration and the usage
* The readme should indicate that full responsibility lies with the developer of the community integration. This includes customer support and maintenance of the code. It should also indicate that the integration was __not created by MultiSafepay__
* If MultiSafepay decides to add the community integration as one of the supported integrations by MultiSafepay, we will have the authority to also remove the community integration without the breach of contract
* It is required for the community integration to have updates. A support tab would be ideal to have, but is not compulsory.
* If you have any further questions about being part of the community Integration Team, feel free to contact <integration@multisafepay.com>

__Please note: MultiSafepay expects you to provide outstanding service and support to merchants. If MultiSafepay receives a number of complaints from merchants, we will contact you to resolve the matter at hand.__
