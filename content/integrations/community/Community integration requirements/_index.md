At MultiSafepay, our developers code on a daily basis to process in-house transactions. However, there are also many fantastic developers worldwide who code wrappers, plugins, applications and other various code in order to work with us.

We are happy to give a place on our documentation page if you have created an integration with us. If you would like for your project to appear on our documentation page, please contact the MultiSafepay Integration Team at integration@multisafepay.com

We would like to outline the main requirements that external integrations should adhere to if they wish to be a part of the MultiSafepay community. These agreements are the following:

* The [integration information](https://docs.multisafepay.com/api/#plugin-information) should be visible and provided on the page and further include a detailed description of the configuration of the integration and the usage
* The responsibility lies with the developer of the integration, and we expect you to provide customer support and maintenance of the code.
* On your page it should indicate that the integration was not created by MultiSafepay
* If MultiSafepay decides to add the integration as one of the supported integrations by MultiSafepay, we will have the authority to also remove the community integration without the breach of contract
* If you have any further questions about being part of the community Integration Team, feel free to contact integration@multisafepay.com

__Please note: MultiSafepay expects you to provide outstanding service and support to merchants. If MultiSafepay receives a number of complaints from merchants, we will contact you to resolve the matter at hand.__
