At MultiSafepay, our developers write code to process in-house transactions. However, there are also many fantastic developers worldwide who create code wrappers, plugins, and applications in order to integrate our products and services.

We are happy to accompany you, starting with a place on our documentation pages as well as assist you on a marketing level. If you would like for your project to become a part of MultiSafepay Docs, email our Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

If you want to publish a MultiSafepay community integration, you have to adhere to the following agreements:

* The [plugin information](https://docs.multisafepay.com/api/#plugin-information) should be visible in the JSON format and include the configuration of the integration
* The readme should indicate that full responsibility lies with the developer of the community integration. This includes customer support and maintenance of the code. It should also be clear that the integration was __not created by MultiSafepay__
* If we decide to add the community integration as one of the supported integrations by MultiSafepay, we will have the authority to also remove the community integration without the breach of contract
* The community integration should be updated to maintain its functionality.

If you have any questions about being part of the community Integration Team, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

__MultiSafepay expects you to provide a high level of service and support to merchants. Possible action may be taken if we receive a high number of complaints.__
