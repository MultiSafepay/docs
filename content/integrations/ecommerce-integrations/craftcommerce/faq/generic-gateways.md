The Craft Commerce plugin offers [generic gateways](/faq/general/generic-gateways/) and/or generic gift cards.

It is possible to set the gateway code and gateway label. All of our payment methods are supported.
 
Refunds of generic gateway transactions are only possible through [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).
