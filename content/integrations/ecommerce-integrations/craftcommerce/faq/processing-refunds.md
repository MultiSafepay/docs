You can process refunds for all payment methods except billing suites from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) or the Craft CMS admin panel.

To process refunds from the Craft Commerce admin panel:  

1. Go to **Commerce** > **Orders**.
2. Select the order.
3. To see the refund options, go to the **Transactions** tab.

For generic gateway transactions, you can only process refunds through [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).
