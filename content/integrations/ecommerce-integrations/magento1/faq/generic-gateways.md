The Magento 1 plugin offers 3 [generic gateways](/faq/general/generic-gateways/) and 3 generic gift cards under the gateway and gift card sections respectively.
All of our payment methods are supported. It is possible to set the gateway code, gateway logo, gateway label, and whether the shopping cart should be included in the transaction.
Refunding and backend orders are fully supported.
