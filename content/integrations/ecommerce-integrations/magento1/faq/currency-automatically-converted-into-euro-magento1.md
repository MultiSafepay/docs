MultiSafepay processes payments in Euros (EUR) as a standard [currency](/faq/general/which-currencies-are-supported-by-multisafepay)
Our Magento 1 plugin is developed based on this.

However, if your webshop uses a different currency, simply change the configuration in the plugin settings:

_System_ > _Configuration_ > _MultiSafepay x.x.x_ > _Connect Settings_ > _Allow currency conversion to Euro_ > _No_.
