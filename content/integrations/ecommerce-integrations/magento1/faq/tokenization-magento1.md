1. Read the page about [tokenization](/tools/tokenization/tokenization-api-level)
2. Enable Tokenization via _Stores > Configuration > MultiSafepay > MultiSafepay Settings_

Note: 
The Tokenization feature is not available for the Credit Card gateway. 
You are required to enable the Visa, Mastercard and/or Maestro gateways separately in order to have this feature. This will make the _"Save Card"_ option available during the checkout process.
