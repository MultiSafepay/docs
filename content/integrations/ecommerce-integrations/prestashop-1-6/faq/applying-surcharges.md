Applying [surcharges](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#surcharge) or payment fees is not automatically enabled in our PrestaShop 1.6 plugin.

## Using BVK
To apply a surcharge or payment fee to a payment method, you can use the third-party [BVK](https://www.bvkyazilim.com/cart/prestashop-modules) package.

## Support
The Integration Team will do their best to support you with installing BVK, but bear in mind that it is a third-party package. We can't guarantee perfect compatibility.

## PSD2 implications
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/security-and-legal/payment-regulations/about-payment-service-directive-2).
