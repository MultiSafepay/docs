If you don't use any external shipping method, you must enable My carrier. If disabled, no MultiSafepy payment methods appear in your webshop frontend.

To enable the standard shipping method `my carrier`, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your PrestaShop 1.7 backend.
2. Go to **Payment method** > **Preferences**.
3. Under **Carrier restrictions** > **My carrier**, enable MultiSafepay.
