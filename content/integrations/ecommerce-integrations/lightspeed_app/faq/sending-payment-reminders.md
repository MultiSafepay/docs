The Lightspeed app doesn't support [Second Chance](/tools/second-chance/how-does-it-work) emails because Lightspeed orders expire after 12 hours. 

Lightspeed offers a functionality that lets you configure payment reminders and emails for orders with **Pending** status. For more information and instructions, see Lightspeed - [Configuring payment reminders](https://ecom-support.lightspeedhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/220661507-Configuring-payment-reminders)
