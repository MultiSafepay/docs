### Disabling payment methods
You can disable payment methods in the **Payment methods ordering list**. Disabled payment methods appear with a strikethrough.

To disable payment methods for specific languages:

1. Under **Payment methods ordering**, select the relevant country.
2. For each language, disable the relevant payment methods. 

If no specific language rule-set, **Default** is used.

### Missing payment methods

By default, newly activated payment methods in MultiSafepay Control are disabled in the Lightspeed app's MultiSafepay payments settings. You need to enable them in both environments.

If a payment method is missing:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/multisafepay-control) and check that the payment method is enabled.
2. Log in to your Lightspeed app, go to **Settings**, and then enable the payment method again.
