If you are using the old [core Lightspeed MultiSafepay payment integration](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/lightspeed_core):

1. Complete the steps mentioned in the [manual](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/lightspeed_app/#manual) to install the Lightspeed app

2. Make sure that the new integration works as intended by placing a test order

3. Open the [old MultiSafepay payment gateway settings](https://services.webshopapp.com/login/?redirect=/payment_providers/859452) and disable the payment provider

4. If at any point you would like to switch back to the old integration, you can uninstall the app from the app store and re-enable the old integration.
