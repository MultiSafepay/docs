Yes, The _Payment methods ordering_ section on the _Settings_ page allows you to change the order in which the MultiSafepay payment methods are shown in the checkout. The order can be changed by dragging and dropping the items in the list. __Do not forget to save the settings after making a change!__

If you want a different payment method order for different languages, you can also configure this. In the drop-down menu under the _Payment methods ordering_ header you can select a country and make a change on a per language basis.
The _Default_ order is used if no specific ruleset for a country is set up.
