To set a minimum order amount for a payment method to display on your checkout page, follow these steps:

1. In the **Payment methods ordering** list, click the **+** button to open the relevant payment method.
2. In the **Minimum** field, enter an amount in EUR cents. E.g. A minimum value of 1500 cents means the payment method only appears on the checkout page if the total order amount is **more** then 15 EUR.

### Setting a minimum order amount per language

To set different minimum order amounts for different languages, under the **Payment methods ordering** header > **Country** dropdown menu, select a country and set the minimum amount per language.

If no specific rule is set for a language, **Default** language is used.
