### About the new login method

In early 2021, we have changed the login method for the MultiSafepay Payment app for Lightspeed eCom. The old login method was password-based, while the new method uses the single sign-on provided by Lightspeed. This means you can directly log in via the Lightspeed eCom store to our settings page of the app.

### The steps

1. Log in to the /admin section of your Lightspeed store

2. Navigate to _Apps_ in the sidebar

3. Click on _Purchased apps_ / _Aangeschafte apps_

4. Go to apps in the side bar

5. Click on the name of our app: _MultiSafepay Payments_
{{< screen src="/integrations/ecommerce integrations/lightspeed_app/faq/img/my-apps-click-name.png" align="center" class="small-img desktop-radius" >}}

_**Alternatively**: paste "/admin/store/apps/1517" after the base URL of your store.  
This should bring you to the store page immediately._

6. On the store page click on _Go to App_ / _Ga naar App_

_**Please note:** This particular login method uses the single sign-on provided by Lightspeed and therefore you do not need to click the **Login** button._
