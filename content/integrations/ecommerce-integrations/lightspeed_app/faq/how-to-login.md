### About the new login method

In early 2021, we have changed the login method for the MultiSafepay Payment app for Lightspeed eCom. The old login method was password-based, while the new method uses the single sign-on provided by Lightspeed. This means you can directly log in via the Lightspeed eCom store to our settings page of the app.

### The process

Step 1: Log in to the /admin section of your Lightspeed store

Step 2: Navigate to **Apps** in the sidebar

Step 3: Click on **Purchased apps** / **Aangeschafte apps**

Step 4: Go to apps in the side bar

Step 5: Click on the name of our app: **MultiSafepay Payments**

**Alternatively**: paste "/admin/store/apps/1517" after the base URL of your store.  
This should bring you to the store page immediately.

Step 6: On the store page click on _Go to App_ / _Ga naar App_

**Note:** This login method uses Lightspeed's single sign-on, therefore you don't need to click the **Login** button.
