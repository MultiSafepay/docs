This is the Lightspeed app. For the Lightspeed core integration, see [Lightspeed core](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/lightspeed_core).

This technical manual is for installing and configuring the MultiSafepay app for Lightspeed.

We recommend first installing the plugin in a test environment following the recommended Lightspeed installation procedure. Make sure you have made a backup.

### Requirements
- MultiSafepay account â€“ See [Getting started](/guides/getting-started/).
- A MultiSafepay [API key](/tools/multisafepay-control/get-your-api-key))

### Notes

- The application is tested using the default one-step and one-page checkout using the default theme.

- For the best user experience, we provide some Javascript and images in order to add, for example, a drop-down for iDEAL and MultiSafepay icons for other payment methods. Some user-added themes or scripts may cause issues, e.g. missing images for payment methods. For assistance, ask your developer. All payment methods still work if you don't use the Javascript files. 
- To use MultiSafepay payment icons, see GitHub [MultiSafepay icons](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/MultiSafepay-icons).
