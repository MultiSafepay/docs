We will be describing the necessary steps to update a plugin using the extension installer tool in the backend.

Before starting this process make sure you are updating from plugin version equals or higher than 2.2.0

1. For security, always create backup of your OpenCart application.
2. Download the Plugin_OpenCart_3.x.x.ocmod.zip.
3. Before you update the plugin, we strongly recommend to have a backup of your production environment.
4. Log in to your backend and navigate to _Extensions_ > _Installer_.
5. Click on the upload button and select the downloaded file.
6. Wait until the installation process is finished. 
7. Click in the menu item _Dashboard_.
8. On the upper right corner of the screen, click on the blue button with a cog wheel icon, and then click on the refresh icon to clean both caches. 
9. Go to _Extensions_ > _Modifications_ and click on refresh button.
10. Go to _Extensions_ > _Payments_ > _MultiSafepay_ and click in the edit button to access the settings page.
11. You will see a warning notification message, indicating it is needed to make some maintenance tasks to delete old plugin files. 
12. Go to _Maintenance_ tab and at the end of the list; click on the button to delete old plugin files. 
13. You just update the plugin. Now you need to configure the settings.
