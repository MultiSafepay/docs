To process full refunds from your OpenCart backend, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your OpenCart backend.
2. Go to **Orders** > **Order view button** > **Order history panel**. 
3. Click the **Refund** button. This only appears if the order status is **Completed** or **Shipped**.

You can also process refunds from your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
