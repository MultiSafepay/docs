The plugin supports the OpenCart core checkout and is compatible with most premium themes, unless you have a custom checkout.

You can request a patch for the following third party theme plugins:

- [Journal3 Quick Checkout For OpenCart 3.0.X](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/opencart/patches/multisafepay-patch-for-journal3.ocmod.zip)
- [Journal3 Quick Checkout For OpenCart 2.3.X](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/opencart/patches/multisafepay-patch-for-journal3-opencart-2.3.X.ocmod.zip)

The Integration Team will do their best to provide support for third-party plugins and premium themes. Email them at <integration@multisafepay.com>
