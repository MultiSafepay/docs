If you want to use payment links in order confirmation e-mails for orders created in the backend, we suggest upgrading to our [new Magento 2 plugin](/integrations/plugins/magento2/).

If you cannot upgrade to the new Magento 2 plugin immediately, and you need this feature enabled in the deprecated plugin, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
