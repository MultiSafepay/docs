To process refunds and credit memos from your Magento 2 backend, follow these steps:  

1. Log in to your Magento 2 backend. 
2. On the **Invoices** tab, click the invoice created by MultiSafepay, and then click **Credit memo**. 
3. Click the relevant refund button:

- **Offline refund**: Doesn't send a refund request to MultiSafepay.
- **Refund**: Sends a refund request to MultiSafepay.

## Deprecated plugin
You can refund orders for payment methods from the deprecated plugin in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), but not from your Magento 2 backend. 

## Fooman surcharges
You can refund orders with a [Fooman surcharge](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/magento2/faq/applying-surcharges/) applied in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), but not from your Magento 2 backend.
