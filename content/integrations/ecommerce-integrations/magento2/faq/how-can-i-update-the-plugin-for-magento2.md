The plugin can be updated via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

Before you update the plugin, we strongly recommend the following:

* Make sure you have a backup of your production environment
* Test the plugin in a staging environment.

Go to our [Manual](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/magento2/#manual) page and follow the instructions from step 7.
