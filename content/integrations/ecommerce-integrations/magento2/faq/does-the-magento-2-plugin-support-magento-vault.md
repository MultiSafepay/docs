Yes. Our latest Magento 2 plugin supports Magento Vault. In essence, Magento Vault is Tokenization with the use of the Magento payment gateway.

This functionality stores payment methods as a token in the Magento database and decreases the purchase time for returning customers,  thus enhancing the conversion rate by facilitating a fast and secure checkout process.

The [Recurring Payments](/tools/recurring-payments/) feature must be enabled in your MultiSafepay Control before Magento Vault can be activated in your Magento backend. Please refer to _[How to activate Recurring Payments](/tools/recurring-payments/how-to-activate-recurring-payments/)_ for more information.

If you have any questions about the Magento Vault integration, please contact <integration@multisafepay.com>
