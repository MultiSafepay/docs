The Magento 2 plugin offers a [generic gateway](/faq/general/generic-gateways/).
It can be found under the MultiSafepay payment methods inside the MultiSafepay configuration:

_Stores_ > _Configuration_ > _MultiSafepay_ > _Payment Methods_ > _Generic Gateway_

- You enter the gateway code and upload a custom gateway image.
- You also need to set if the gateway requires a shopping cart or not.
- It works for the most part as a regular redirect payment method.
- Except for recurring payments, all the features like refunding and creating a backend order are supported.

- If you have any questions regarding the integration of the generic gateway, email our Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
