The MultiSafepay Magento 2 plugin supports Magento Vault, which is essentially a means of tokenization using the Magento payment gateway.

Magento Vault:

- Stores payment methods as a token in the Magento database
- Minimizes purchase time for returning customers
- Facilitates a fast, secure checkout process
- Increases conversion

## Activating Magento Vault
To activate Magento Vault in your Magento back end, you must first enable [recurring payments](/tools/recurring-payments/) in your MultiSafepay Control. 

For more information, see:

- [How to activate Recurring Payments](/tools/recurring-payments/how-to-activate-recurring-payments/) 
- [Requirements](/tools/recurring-payments/what-is-recurring-payments/#3-requirements)

For any questions about integrating Magento Vault, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
