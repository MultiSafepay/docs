From version 2.0 and higher, payment links are automatically generated for every order using a MultiSafepay payment method.

To retrieve a payment link for a customer, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Magento 2 backend.
2. Go to **Sales** > **Orders** > **Create new order**, and then create an order.
3. Go to the **Orders overview**, and then select the newly created order.
4. Go to **Comments history**.  
5. Under **Notes for this order**, copy the payment link.
6. Send the payment link to the customer.
