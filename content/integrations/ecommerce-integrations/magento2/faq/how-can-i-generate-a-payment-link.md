From plugin version 2.0 and higher, payment links are automatically generated for every order with a MultiSafepay payment method. Please follow these instructions:

1. Create an order as per usual under _Sales_ > _Orders_ > _Create New Order_
2. Once the order is created, go back to the _Orders overview_ and select the newly created order
3. Click the order and go to _Comments History_
4. The payment link is now displayed under _Notes for this Order_
5. You can then copy and paste the link and send it to the customer.
