The deprecated plugin could be installed through various ways, depending on the way you installed it, it can be deleted as follows:

### 1. Composer
You can either choose to only remove the code base or a full uninstallation including database entries and configuration removal.

#### Option 1: Removing the code base
``` 
composer remove multisafepay/magento2msp
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

#### Option 2: Complete uninstall (including database entries and configuration removal)
``` 
bin/magento module:uninstall MultiSafepay_Connect --remove-data --clear-static-content
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

You can also optionally choose to create a backup of certain parts of the plugin by adding the following parameters: _--backup-code_, _--backup-media_ and _--backup-db_

Please take a look at the [Magento docs](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-uninstall-mods.html#instgde-cli-uninst-mod-uninst) for all the available parameters.

### 2. app/code

```

To remove the code base, you can delete the app/code/MultiSafepay/Connect directory:
```
cd app/code/MultiSafepay
rm -rf Connect
```

### 3. Marketplace
