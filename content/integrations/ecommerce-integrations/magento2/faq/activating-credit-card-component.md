The MultiSafepay Magento 2 plugin supports the Credit Card Component, which lets you accept credit card payments from your checkout page.

The component:

- Provides a seamless checkout experience to increase conversion.
- Encrypts customer payment details for secure processing.
- Shifts responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) to MultiSafepay.

For more information, see [Payment Components](/integrations/payment-components/).

If you're new to accepting credit card payments, apply to activate them.
