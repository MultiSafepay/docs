Yes, the plugin is compatible with GraphQL queries and easy to integrate into your PWA store with an additional [module for GraphQL support](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2-graphql).  
We also have full extensions for the next storefronts: ScandiPWA, Vue Storefront. You can find more information about available integrations [here](/integrations/pwa/).
