The Magento 2 plugin supports [generic gateways](/faq/general/generic-gateways/). Generic gateways work like regular redirect payment methods. All features are supported, except for recurring payments.

## Configuring generic gateways
To configure generic gateways, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Magento 2 backend.
2. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **MultiSafepay** > **Payment methods** > **Generic gateway**.

- Enter the gateway code and upload a custom gateway image.
- Specify if the gateway requires a shopping cart or not.

For any questions about integrating generic gateways, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>
