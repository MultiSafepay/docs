You can process refunds directly from your WooCommerce backend, and from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).

You can process full and partial refunds for all payment methods, except [billing suites](/payment-methods/billing-suite) for which you can only process **full** refunds.
