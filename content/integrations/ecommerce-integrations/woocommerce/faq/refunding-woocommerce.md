Yes, you can fully or partially refund transactions directly from your WooCommerce backend.
You can also refund from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)

__Please note: it is not possible to process partial refund, only full refunds, for [Billing Suite](/payment-methods/billing-suite) payment method transactions.__
