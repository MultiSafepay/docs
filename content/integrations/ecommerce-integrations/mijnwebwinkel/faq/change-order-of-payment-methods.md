Yes, you can change the order of the payment methods in the checkout of Mijnwebwinkel. Go to the following [page](https://www.mijnwebwinkel.nl/beheer/payment/sorting) and choose 'Sort manually, defined below'.

Under this option, you can drag and drop the active payment methods in any way you like.
