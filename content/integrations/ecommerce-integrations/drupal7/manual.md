This technical manual is for installing and configuring the MultiSafepay plugin for Drupal 7.

We recommend first installing the plugin in a test environment following the recommended Shopware 6 installation procedure. Make sure you have made a backup.

- Tested on PHP 7.0

## Installation and configuration
1. Unpack the content of the .ZIP file in the root of your Drupal 7 webshop.
2. Log in to your Drupal 7 backend.
3. Go to **Site settings** > **Modules**. 
4. Enable the Commerce MultiSafepay JSON module, and your selected payment method modules. 
5. Click **Save configuration**.
6. Go to **Store settings** > **Advanced store settings** > **Payment methods**.
7. **Enable** the `multisafepay` core module.
8. **Enable** the modules for each payment method.
9. To configure each payment method, under **Actions**, click the **Edit** button.
10. When the main module is installed, two rules are created but disabled by default:  
    * MultiSafepay order paid in full: Order state to `processing`  
This rule sets the order to `processing` when the order is paid in full.  

    * MultiSafepay order complete: Shipped at MultiSafepay  
This rule updates the transaction status to **Shipped** at MultiSafepay. For Pay After Delivery, Klarna, and E-invoicing, this triggers the invoicing process.
