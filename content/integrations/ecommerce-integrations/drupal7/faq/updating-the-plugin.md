There are 3 ways to update the Drupal 7 plugin:

- In your Drupal 7 backend
- In the CMS marketplace 
- Using SFTP

To update the plugin using SFTP, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a backup of your production environment, and that you test the plugin in a staging environment.
2. From the [Drupal 7 manual](/integrations/drupal7/manual), download the plugin again.
3. Follow the Installation and configuration instructions from step 2.
