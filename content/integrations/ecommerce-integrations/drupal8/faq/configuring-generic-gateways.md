The MultiSafepay plugin for Drupal 8 & 9 supports [generic gateways](/faq/general/generic-gateways/).

## Configuring generic gateways
Go to **Commerce** > **Configuration** > **Payments** > **Payments gateways** > **Add payment gateway** > **Generic gateway**.

All MultiSafepay payment methods are supported. You can specify the gateway code and the gateway label.
