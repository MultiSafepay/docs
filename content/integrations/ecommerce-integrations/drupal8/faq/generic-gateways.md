The MultiSafepay plugin for Drupal 8 & 9 offers [generic gateways](/faq/general/generic-gateways/).

You can find the generic gateway in your Drupal backend. Navigate to Commerce > Configuration > Payments > Payments Gateways > Add payment gateway > Generic Gateway

All of our payment methods are supported. It is possible to set the gateway code and the gateway label.
