## User guide

### Generic gateways

The plugin supports generic gateways, which redirect customers from your checkout to a MultiSafepay [payment page](/docs/payment-pages/). This is particularly useful for integrating gift cards.

<details id="how-to-configure-generic-gateways">
<summary>How to configure generic gateways</summary>
<br>

1. Sign in to your Shopware 6 backend.
2. Go to **MultiSafepay settings**.
3. Set the relevant [payment method gateway IDs](/reference/gateway-ids/).

You can filter generic gateways by country, and minimum and maximum amount.

</details>

### Payment components

The plugin supports [payment components](/docs/payment-components/), which:

- Provide a seamless checkout experience to increase <<glossary:conversion>>.
- Encrypt customer payment details for secure processing.
- Shift responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/docs/pci-dss/) to MultiSafepay.

<details id="how-to-activate-payment-components">
<summary>How to activate payment components</summary>
<br>

If you're new to accepting card payments, email a request to activate them to <risk@multisafepay.com>

1. Sign in to your Shopware backend.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payment**.
3. Select each payment method, and then enable the **Component** toggle.

For questions, email <integration@multisafepay.com>

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** If you have a custom checkout and encounter a conflict with the payment component, the Integration Team will do their best to provide support, but we can't guarantee compatibility in all cases.

</details>

### Payment methods

By default, any payment method you activate in your MultiSafepay account will be available for your backend. Newly activated payment methods must be enabled manually in your <<glossary:backend>> settings.

### Recurring payments

[Recurring payments](/docs/recurring-payments) are supported.

<details id="how-to-enable-recurring-payments">
<summary>How to enable recurring payments</summary>
<br>

1. Sign in to your Shopware backend.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payment**.
3. Select each payment method, and then enable the **Tokenization** toggle.

</details>

### Refunds

[Full and partial refunds](/docs/refund-payments/) **except** for <<glossary:BNPL>> methods are supported in your MultiSafepay dashboard and backend.  
You cannot refund more than the original amount in your backend.

<details id="how-to-process-backend-refunds">
<summary>How to process backend refunds</summary>
<br>

1. In your Shopware 6 backend, go to the **Order details** page.
2. In the **Refund** field, enter the refund amount.

### Shipping orders

For <<glossary:BNPL>> orders, once shipped, the delivery status must be manually updated from **Open** to **Shipped**. This change will then automatically reflect in your MultiSafepay dashboard.

## Updates

&nbsp; **üí° Tip!** Make sure you have a backup of your production environment, and that you test the plugin in a staging environment.
