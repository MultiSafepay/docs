We test all our ready-made integrations before release, but your integration may still encounter configuration issues or a bug - especially if you have created your own self-made integration.

We are best able to support issues that are reproducible in a standard website environment. But we always try to offer support, even for issues outside our scope.

# Basics 
When we start trying to reproduce an issue, we always begin with the basics. 

Help us by answering the following questions:

- Does the issue occur in the plugin core?
- Does it occur in the payment method core?
- When did the issue start occuring?
- Has there been a recent plugin or system update?
- Can you reproduce the issue?
- Do you have any examples?

# Integration Team rules

- We conduct our investigations in a staging or test environment of your ecommerce platform. Create a temporary username and a <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/nl/features/password-generator" target="_blank">strong password</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> to give us access. Always delete the temporary account after we finish the investigation.

- We only ask for the credentials for your live ecommerce platform account in extraordinary circumstances. In such cases, we recommended making a backup beforehand, just in case.

> ⚠️ **Note:** 
> MultiSafepay assumes **no** responsibility for mistakes in your live environment.
>
> - If we require server access, we work exclusively with SFTP and SSH, using Port 22. For security reasons, we no longer support the FTP protocol.
> 
> - If we cannot reproduce an issue in a standard staging or test environment, we consider it a _time-boxed project_. This means we allocate a limited period of time to work on it further. We cannot guarantee a solution.
