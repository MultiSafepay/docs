### Integrate into PWA store using a separate extension that adds GraphQL support

Please see our GitHub repo for the [integration instructions and GraphQL request examples](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2-graphql) for PWA based stores.

### PWA theme payment component

Please keep in mind that you will need to create a custom payment component for PWA storefront, depending on which PWA storefront you are using.
