Automatically reconciling sales from your site with payments received via MultiSafepay saves time and increases accuracy.

xCore offers two reconciliation apps for Exact accounting tools. The apps automatically retrieve the details of all payments for the day from MultiSafepay, and then match each payment to the corresponding open item in Exact.
