The accountant export lists all successful incoming and outgoing transactions, including the:

- Amount
- Payment method
- [Transaction status](/about-payments/multisafepay-statuses/) (at the time the report was generated)

{{< details title="Supported formats" >}}

* CAMT053
* CODA
* CSV
* MT940
* XLS
* XLSX

{{< details title="Exclusions" >}}
&nbsp;  
MultiSafepay does not collect funds for PayPal. Therefore, PayPal transactions don't automatically appear in the accountant export. 

To include them, in your dashboard or [backend](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#backend), set the transaction status to **Completed**.
