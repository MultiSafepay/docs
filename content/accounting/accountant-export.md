# Importing into accounting platforms

You can import accountant exports into a range of third-party [accounting platforms](/accounting/integrations/).

# Including PayPal transactions

<details id="including-paypal-transactions">
<summary>Including PayPal transactions</summary>
<br>

MultiSafepay does not collect funds for PayPal, therefore these transactions don't automatically appear in the report.  


To include them, in your dashboard or <<glossary:backend>>, set the transaction status to **Completed**.
