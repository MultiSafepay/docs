You can refund customers more than the value of the original transaction, e.g. if you want to cover the customer's postage costs when returning an order. 

This option is only available for debit card transactions, and **not** for credit cards or post-payment methods. A maximum ammount limit applies. 

To enable this option:

1. Email your request to your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>
2. The Risk Team assesses your application. 
3. Once approved, the Risk Team enables the **Allow more than original** function in your MultiSafepay Control.
4. Activate the function in your MultiSafepay Control account.
