## Why does MultiSafepay charge VAT?
In 2016, MultiSafepay began acting as acquirer for some payment methods to offer end-to-end payment processing and reporting services, and increase availability and reliability. As a result, we were required to start charging VAT.

If you provide us with your local VAT registration number to include in our monthly invoice, standard Dutch VAT of 21% can be shifted and won't be charged to you.

## How is VAT charged?
VAT is charged on all MultiSafepay fees: 
- Transaction fees
- Bank fees
- Payout and refund fees 

Transaction fees are charged as each transaction is processed. Bank fees and VAT are charged to your account at the beginning of each month.

## When is VAT deducted from my account?

VAT is automatically deducted from your MultiSafepay Control account balance at the end of each month. 

To view the exact amount in your MultiSafepay Control > **Transaction overview**, enter `VAT` or `Invoice` as a search query. 

## VAT invoices

Monthly VAT invoices are for your records only. You don't need to pay the amount separately.

They are uploaded to your MultiSafepay Control **> Finance > Invoices**.

We also email the invoices to the **Financial email** address in your MultiSafepay Control. If you have not added an email address here, we will send them to the main business email address listed in your account.

To add a financial email address in your MultiSafepay Control, go to **Contact Information**.  

### Why are refunds stated twice on my invoice?
One entry refers to the payment methods for which MultiSafepay is the collecting party, and the other to payment methods for which we are not.

### How is the transaction fee total calculated?
The transaction fee total is the sum of all processed and completed transactions within a specified timeframe and the (universal) transaction fee agreed when you signed up with MultiSafepay.

### What exchange rate do you use on the invoice and where can I find it?
We always use our bank's closing exchange rate from the previous day. The exchange rate is not displayed on the invoice, but it is easy to calculate.

Simply divide the EUR amount by the foreign currency amount (or the other way around depending on your target currency).

### Why do I pay VAT on some payment methods but not others?
As the collecting party for most payment methods, MultiSafepay is responsible for charging VAT. For other payment methods (e.g. PayPal), we are not the collecting party, and for these transactions VAT is applied via the scheme to avoid double taxation. 

Transactions for which MultiSafepay is **not** the collecting party are listed on your invoice with zero VAT value.

## Can I reverse-charge VAT?
You can only request to reverse-charge VAT if you are **not** registered as a Dutch company. You must also register your VAT number with MultiSafepay.

To register your VAT number, email the Finance Team at <invoice@multisafepay.com>

## What are the actual costs to be paid for IC ++ tariffs?
There are three cost components of the IC++ model:
- The Interchange fee that is paid to the issuing bank
- The scheme fee charged by Visa or Mastercard
- The acquirer fee 

These costs vary considerably depending on a range of factors, including the:
- Merchant's country
- Issuing bank 
- Cardholder 
- Merchant segment
- Monthly transaction volume 

When you sign up with MultiSafepay, we will provide you an estimate of these costs.
