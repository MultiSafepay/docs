In accordance with our [PCI DSS](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) certification and other obligations, we regularly perform security checks on our system, including penetration tests (pen tests). Pen tests are a form of ethical hacking that simulate a cyberattack in order to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
