#### ip_address
Post-payment and credit card payment methods require the customer <i>ip_address</i> to be validated and thus, we need the actual IP address of the end user within the <i>ip_address</i> field. This means that the optional parameter <i>"ip_address (optional)</i> within the JSON request is now a <i>"required"</i> field when processing post-payment and/or credit card transactions.

Please note! When validating the localhost <i>ip_address</i> instead of the end user's <i>ip_address</i>, it may result in transactions being marked with the status _uncleared_ or even be rejected/declined.


```shell
   "customer": {
        "ip_address": "31.148.195.10",
        "forwarded_ip": "" 
```

#### forwarded_ip

The X-FORWARDED-FOR header of the customer request when using a proxy.

<i>forwarded_ip</i> is to be used when there is a proxy. In all other cases they need to use the <i>ip_address</i> to retrieve the IP address of the customer.


#### Uncleared status or Declined 
Due to the validation on the IP address of the end user (customer) a transaction can unnecessarily be marked with the status _uncleared_ or even be declined. 

Before a payment is accepted, a fraud check will take place on the transaction. The required ip_address field is one of the checks processed in the validation of the payment. When provided with an empty or incorrect IP address (by providing the ip_address of the webshop instead of the customer), the chances that the transaction will be marked with the status _uncleared_ are very high. 

Credit cards and post-payment methods represent a high risk for fraud. Therefore, the validation of each transaction will automatically take place to protect the merchants processing with MultiSafepay.
