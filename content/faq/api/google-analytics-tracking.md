You can track the behavior of your customers through Google Analytics [tracking](/api/#create-an-order).  

This only applies to redirect calls. When the customer reaches the MultiSafepay payment page, the UA-code is generated and appears in the HTML.

Tracking isn't available for direct calls because the customer doesn't go to a MultiSafepay page between checkout and the successful payment page. 

For more information, see [Difference between direct and redirect calls](/faq/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect).
