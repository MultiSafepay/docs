As online payment provider, MultiSafepay is obliged by law to monitor transactions and itâ€™s clients. As a result, it must be clear to MultiSafepay what type of service or products are purchased per transaction and by whom.

Please help us in our duty by sending: 

* the exact product details
* client name
* customer IP-address
* country
* email address

for all orders automatically. Failure of sending the required information may result in extra screening steps from MultiSafepay and/or a request for copies of invoices of specific orders.
