International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN) are sensitive data. 

For security reasons, we mask IBAN by default in:

- [POST notifications](/faq/api/notification-url/#post-notification-example)
- [GET /orders/{order_id}](/api/#retrieve-an-order) responses

When masked, only the last 4 digits of the IBAN are visible, e.g. `*** 1234`.

### Unmasking IBAN

You can still perform most business operations with a masked IBAN, e.g. processing refunds.
To unmask an IBAN for a specific website, email your reasons to your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

Once your account manager has approved your request, follow these steps:

1. In your MultiSafepay Control, go to **Settings** > **Website settings**.
2. Click the relevant website.
3. Under **Website functionality**, click the **Unmask IBAN numbers in API requests and responses** toggle.

**Note:** The unmask toggle is always visible, but only active if approved by your account manager.

When unmasked, the full IBAN is displayed, e.g. `NL87ABNA0000001234`.
