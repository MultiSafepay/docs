3D Secure is an additional security layer used in online credit and debit card transactions. The major credit card companies each offer their own version of 3D Secure. These are Verified by Visa, Mastercard SecureCode, J/Secure and American Express SafeKey.

3D Secure technology adds an extra step to placing an order and is intended for your safety and that of your customers. Your customers are protected against abuse of their credit card number. Before the payment is accepted, the cardholder identity is verified by requiring the customer to authenticate at the credit card provider's 3D Secure website.

When a chargeback is filed against the merchant, and the transaction was carried out through the 3D Secure system, the acquiring bank is responsible for the costs and not the merchant.
