MultiSafepay is legally required to periodically review all merchant accounts to maintain a close relationship and ensure the accuracy of company information in our system. 

We check if your company is still active and if there have been any changes in the business model, directors, and ultimate beneficial ownership since onboarding or the last review. 

If we pick up any changes, we email you to confirm or request new documentation, e.g. updated UBO statements or copies of identification documents. 

If you fail to respond to such a request, we will initially pause your payouts and may ultimately unilaterally terminate your contract.
