### A new bank account
If you would like to add a new bank account for payouts, please add the new IBAN in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) A payment in the amount of 1 EUR transferred from your business bank account (you can initiate this procedure in MultiSafepay Control) is required. Alternatively, you can provide a copy of a bank statement/screenshot taken of your online banking environment including IBAN and company name. 

_Important: The company name on your bank statement must be an exact match with one of the trade names on your Chamber of Commerce extract_.

The new bank account will be verified within 5 business days. Please note that we only accept business bank accounts (no private bank accounts) and bank accounts that are registered on the official company name. If you would like to deactivate an old bank account, please inform us via <risk@multisafepay.com> 

Do not forget to mention your Account ID. 

_If more than a bank account has changed within your company, it is advisable to read the following article [Change of company details](/faq/risk-and-fraud/change-of-company-details/)_
