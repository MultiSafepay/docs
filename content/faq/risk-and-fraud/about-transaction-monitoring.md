Under the [Wwft](https://www.fiu-nederland.nl/en/legislation/general-legislation/wwft), MultiSafepay is obliged to monitor the transactions of all merchants. 

We may request a copy of an invoice, e.g. if:

* It is unclear what is being sold.
* The order value is unusually high.
* The order deviates from your normal customer profile.

We may also ask other questions about the transaction. Following our investigation, if we still don't understand the transaction (e.g. if the merchant isn't cooperating), we may pause payouts or take other punitive measures.

For more information, email your account manager or the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
