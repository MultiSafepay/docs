You can cancel a refund if its status is **Reserved**, and the refund won't be paid to the customer. 

The refund status is **Reserved** until midnight on the day the refund was initiated. At midnight, the transaction is passed to the customer's bank to process. You can no longer cancel it via MultiSafepay.
