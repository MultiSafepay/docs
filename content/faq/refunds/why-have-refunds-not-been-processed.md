It takes MultiSafepay a few hours to process the refunds. In case the refund has the status _Reserved_ this can mean two things: 

1. The refund still needs to be processed (refund is settled at midnight the same day, and will have the status _Completed_ thereafter)
2. The refund cannot be processed due to a negative balance. If your balance is not sufficient to process the refunds, the system will wait with the settlement. Please ensure that your balance is always sufficient.
