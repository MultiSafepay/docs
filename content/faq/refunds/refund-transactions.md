It may be the case that refunds are delayed depending on the bank the refund has been issued through.

As soon as outgoing payments are passed on to a bank, the status of an order will change from _Reserved_ to _Completed_. It is then up to the bank to process the outgoing payment.

Although, if the status is marked as _Reserved_, you can still cancel the outgoing payment. Furthemore, outgoing payments are not processed once the balance is insufficient.
