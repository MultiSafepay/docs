You can refund customers more than the amount of the original transaction, e.g. if you want to cover the customer's postage costs when returning an order. 

This option is only available for debit card transactions, and **not** for credit cards or post-payment methods. A maximum ammount limit applies. 

To enable this option:

1. Email your request to your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>
2. The Risk Team assesses your application. 
3. Once approved, the Risk Team enables the **allow more than original** function in your MultiSafepay account.
4. Activate the function in your MultiSafepay account account.
