It is possible to easily refund in batches with our refund script. The refund script takes two parameters: 

1. A .csv file which specifies the order_id, amount and description of every order
2. Your API key. 

The script is written in PHP, so make sure it's used in an environment where a PHP interpreter is installed.

For more information, please follow the instructions on our [Github page](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/refund-script)

If you have any questions, please contact <integration@multisafepay.com>
