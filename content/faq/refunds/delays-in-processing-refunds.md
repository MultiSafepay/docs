It takes MultiSafepay a few hours to process refunds. 

If the status of the refund  is **Reserved**, it may mean:Â 

- The refund hasn't been processed yet. Refunds are passed to the customer's bank at midnight on the day they are initiated, and then the status changes to **Completed**. The bank is now responsible for processing the payment. Refunds may be delayed by the issuing bank.
- The refund cannot be processed due to insufficient funds in your MultiSafepay Control. To top up your balance, see [Adding funds to your MultiSafepay balance](https://docs.multisafepay.com/faq/finance/adding-funds-to-your-multisafepay-balance).
