{{< alert-notice >}} __Please read__: We constantly update the contents of this document. You should expect new information to surface anytime, as specifics about the implementation of the new PSD2 directive are still being worked on. {{< /alert-notice >}}   

## Surcharges
Your right to apply surcharges may vary accordingly by the payment method and the customerâ€™s country. Please note that, even though the PSD2 regulation concerns the whole European Economic Area, states can decide individually on certain aspects of the new directive. You should always check what rules are applicable in the country your business is registered. In the Netherlands, the body charged with the PSD2 oversight is the [Authority for Consumers & Markets (ACM)](https://www.acm.nl)

According to the Dutch National Bank, you should always contact ACM for inquiries. Moreover, each payment method is likely to implement its own provisions in addition to these regulations.

### What is prohibited?
For the majority of payment transactions, retailers are no longer allowed to charge fees for using specific payment methods. 

[Surcharges](/faq/getting-started/glossary/#surcharge) are banned for:

* Most credit card transactions when the bank or card issuer and the payment provider of the merchant are both located in a European Economic Area (EEA) state
* Debit Card transactions (for both individuals and business customers)
* Standard Bank transfers (for both individuals and business customers)
* SEPA Direct Debit (for both individuals and business customers).

### What is permitted?
Certain payment methods do not fall under the surcharge prohibition, as follows:

* For PayPal, retailers are only allowed to charge consumers the actual costs incurred by them when using these payment methods and __may never__ exceed them

* For pay-after-delivery (post-payment) payments, such as Klarna or AfterPay, retailers are only allowed to charge consumers the actual costs incurred by them when using these payment methods and __may never__ exceed them

* Credit card transactions paid with a card issued outside the EU/EEA can still be surcharged (e.g. an overseas tourist with a credit card issued in India)

* American Express and Diners Club are exceptions from the rule, too. Surcharges for these cards can still be applied regardless.


> _Please note that for hybrid card schemes such as American Express and Diners Club, it is up to each country to decide whether or not surcharging is allowed. Dutch law does not prohibit it, but other countries such as France, Belgium and the United Kingdom might deal with this differently_.

### Can I apply surcharges to customers outside the European Union?

The rules regarding surcharging customers outside the European Union remain unchanged. The PSD2 aims at protecting the European customer.

### Do I need to perform any change within the MultiSafepay Control?

If you are currently surcharging payment fees which are no longer allowed according to the new PSD2, you may need to update your settings in the backend of your website. Please get in contact with the support department of the webshop plugin or your web developer to assist you further. You do not need to change any settings in your MultiSafepay Control.

### Do I need to do anything if I do not apply surcharges?

No, you do not need to perform any change if you already do not apply any [surcharges](/faq/getting-started/glossary/#surcharge) on the products or services your webshop sells.
