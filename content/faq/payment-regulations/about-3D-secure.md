3D Secure is an authentication protocol for online credit and debit card paymentss designed to provide an additional layer of security to protect merchants and customers against fraud. When customers enter their payment details, they are redirected to the issuer's site to verify their identity, before completing the payment.

The major credit card schemes each offer their own branded version of 3D Secure:

- American Express Safekey
- Mastercard SecureCode
- Verified by Visa

If a customer requests a [chargeback](/faq/chargebacks/about-chargebacks/) due to fraud but the original transaction passed 3D Secure verification, the acquirer is responsible for the costs instead of the merchant.
