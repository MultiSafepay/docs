'Order Totals' including Custom Order Totals from other extensions created by developers may appear on the MultiSafepay checkout page. Unwanted Custom Order Totals can be excluded in the backend of our plugin in Magento 2. This option will however not be required if the plugin or module removes the custom total from the order when it is not being used.
