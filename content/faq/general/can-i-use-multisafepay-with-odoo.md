Yes, you can. A few external developers created an Odoo app that connects with MultiSafepay. You can find it on the [Odoo website](https://www.odoo.com/apps/modules/browse?search=multisafepay) 

MultiSafepay did not take part in developing the Odoo apps. Therefore, we advise you to contact your developer to assist you further.
