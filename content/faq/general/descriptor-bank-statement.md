## Descriptor

A descriptor allows you to display your company name on a customers' bank statement. This can be enabled in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) by following these steps:

1. Navigate to _Settings_ --> _Website settings_
2. Fill in your company name in the field _Name_

The descriptor will appear and can be adjusted as shown below for the following payment methods:


* iDEAL -> _(trade name) via MultiSafepay_
* Bancontact -> 
* Direct Debit -> _MultiSafepay (account holder name)_
* Credit Cards -> _Legal name as known to MultiSafepay_
* Sofort -> _MultiSafepay_

_Please note that the new name may only be maximum 35 characters._
