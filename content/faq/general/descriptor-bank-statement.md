## Adding a statement descriptor

A descriptor can be used to explain charges on customer's bank statement. We advise you to add your company name to the descriptor. This can be enabled in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) by following these steps:

1. Navigate to _Settings_ > _Website settings_
2. Fill in your company name in the _Name_ field

The descriptor will appear and can be adjusted as shown below for the following payment methods:

* iDEAL > _(trade name) via MultiSafepay_
* Bancontact > 
* Direct Debit > _MultiSafepay (account holder name)_
* Credit Cards > _Legal name as known to MultiSafepay_
* Sofort > _MultiSafepay_

_Please note that the new name may only be maximum 35 characters._
