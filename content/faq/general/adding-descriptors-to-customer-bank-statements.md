You can add a descriptor on customer bank statements to identify charges. We recommend using your company name as the descriptor. You can add descriptors in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Website settings**.
2. In the **Name** field, enter your company name.
3. The descriptor appears.

You can adjust the descriptor for the following payment methods:

* **iDEAL** → (trade name) via MultiSafepay
* **Bancontact** → 
* **Direct Debit** → MultiSafepay (account holder name)
* **Credit Cards** → Legal name known to MultiSafepay
* **Sofort** → MultiSafepay

**Note:** Descriptors can be a maximum of 35 characters.
