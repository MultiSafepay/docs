MultiSafepay processes the following currencies as standard: 

* Euros (EUR)
* Pounds (GBP) 
* Dollars (USD).*

_Please note that the Dollar (USD) is not supported as currency for [bank transfer](/payment-methods/bank-transfer/bank-accounts/)._

## Requirements

1. The currency is only processed when it is supported by the selected [payment method](/payment-methods/)
2. The desired currency is correctly processed within the transaction call, received by MultiSafepay when using [JSON](/api/#orders) requests
3. The plugin settings allow the currency selected
4. The currency is enabled/allowed within your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).

_When multiple currencies are enabled within your MultiSafepay Control, all currencies will be shown under Finance -> Balance_.  

## Add currency to your MultiSafepay Balance

In order to enable more currencies in your MultiSafepay Control, please submit your request with our Support department via <support@multisafepay.com>

## Add multi-currency business bank account to your MultiSafepay Control

Although MultiSafepay provides all currencies, all incoming and outgoing transactions are processed in Euros (EUR) as standard currency.
To process a payout, you must provide us with a business bank account that is able to receive funds in the requested currency.

When you request an extra currency to be added to your MultiSafepay Control, you need to follow a few steps in order to ensure transactions can be processed in that particular currency and that no currency conversion is needed:

1. Add a business bank account in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) that is able to receive the currency.
This can be done through _Finance -> Balance -> Add bank account_

2. Process a bank transfer in the requested currency to confirm the business bank account

3. Once the above has been processed, you can inform the Support department <support@multisafepay.com> to complete the verification procedure. The Risk Team will finalize your request.

## Payout

1. Within your MultiSafepay Control, you will have the possibility to convert the currency to Euros (EUR). This can be done through _Finance -> Currency Conversion_. Take into account the exchange rate and/or costs involved

2. If a business bank account that can receive the currency as is has been added to your MultiSafepay Control (and approved by our Risk Team), a payout can be processed without currency conversion.

_For example, the currency dollar (USD) is paid out in dollar (USD) and received on your business bank account in the dollars (USD) as well._

## Additional currencies available at MultiSafepay

MultiSafepay can process a few additional currencies, as follows:


* Australian Dollar (AUD)
* Canadian Dollar (CAD)
* Swiss franc (CHF)
* Czech koruna (CZK)
* Danish krone (DKK)
* Norwegian krone (NOK)
