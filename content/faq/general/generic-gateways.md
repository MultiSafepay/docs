## Generic Gateways

In our plugins we have predefined gateways linked to our payment methods. Whenever we add a new payment method to our platform every merchant that wants to use it needs to update the plugin that they are using.
For that reason some of our plugins contain one or more generic gateways. These gateways have a flexible gateway code and thus can be used to connect almost every payment method we offer.

### Generic Giftcards 
Since we do not support all of the open-loop giftcards and non of the closed-loop giftcards in our integrations generic gateways can be especially useful for giftcards.
In some of the integrations we have special gateways that act as generic giftcard gateways.

For more information about the integration of both open-loop as closed-loop giftcards in our platform please contact <integration@multisafepay.com>
### Limitations
For now we only support redirect gateways.
