### SSL Certificate Renewal January Update

MultiSafepay continuously works hard to ensure a secure payment infrastructure. We regularly carry out updates and maintenance as it is necessary to maintain a high level of security.

Recently, in January, MultiSafepay has updated its SSL certificate to guarantee the safety of our infrastructure and communication. This renewal ensures that the communication uses the latest security standards to protect both you and us.

The affected systems are the following: 

* Domain
* Sub-domains
* Server communication

This update should not affect your systems or payment processing, although if un-wanted situations arise, please contact us at <integration@multisafepay.com>. This can occur for merchants using custom integrations, whereby the certificate will need to be replaced.

Please note: If you decide to cache the SSL-certificate, MultiSafepay will not hold responsibility, although we are happy to assist you in solving any issues that may arise.
