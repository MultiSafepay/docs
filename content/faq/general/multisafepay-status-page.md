Yes. At MultiSafepay, our systems may encounter outages, although these happen very rarely. When such an event occurs you can refer to the [Status page](https://status.multisafepay.com) where it will list systems that are operational or currently down in real-time. Also, prior incidents are listed with a description of the occurrence along with the time and date it happened.
