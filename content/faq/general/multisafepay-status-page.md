Yes. At MultiSafepay, our systems may encounter outages, although these happen very rarely. When such an event occurs you can refer to our [Status page](https://status.multisafepay.com), which lists the current statuses of all our systems. The status page also features a log where all past incidents are listed with descriptions, time and date.
