3D Secure (3DS) is a authentication protocol for online transactions. 3D Secure is also known by its branded names like Mastercard Identity Check, Visa Secure or American Express SafeKey. When a chargeback is filed against the merchant and the transaction was carried out using the 3D Secure protocol, the acquiring bank is responsible for the costs and not the merchant.

__Please note:__ Starting January 1st 2021, all Europe-based transactions through our platform will use the 3D Secure protocol in order to comply with PSD2 regulations.

## How does 3D Secure relate to PSD2 and SCA?

The Payment Services Directive 2 [(PSD2)](/faq/payment-regulations/payment-service-directive-2/) is a set of laws and regulations that aims to improve European consumer rights while promoting competition within the financial industry. One of the requirements of PSD2 is Strong Customer Authentication [(SCA)](/faq/payment-regulations/strong-customer-authentication/). SCA combines two elements of authentication to reduce the risk of fraud. The 3D Secure authentication protocol is a widely implemented form of SCA that complies with PSD2 regulations.

## What's new in 3DS 2.0?

3DS 2.0 aims to provide better security and greater customer experience than its predecessor. This is achieved through the collection of more contextual data from the customer. This contextual data is used 'behind-the-scenes' to verify the identity of the customer. This reduces the complexity of the check-out flow, resulting in higher conversion and lower cart abandonment. In some cases, the contextual data of legitimate transactions include abnormalities. In these cases customers are asked to provide either a password, code via SMS, fingerprint etc.

We are currently working on supporting 3DS 2.0 and we expect to rollout the support in 2021. In the meantime, transactions use 3DS 1.0 and are fully PSD2 compliant.
