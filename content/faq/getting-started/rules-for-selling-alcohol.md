### Introduction

As a [merchant](/faq/general/glossary/#merchant), you are required to perform age verification during the _sale_ and the _delivery_ of an order that includes alcohol. It is our duty as a payment service provider to ensure that you comply with the legislation and that your customers meet the requirements when purchasing alcohol.

### Requirements

Dutch law states that alcohol cannot be sold to customers under the age of 18. As a merchant, it is mandatory to state this clearly on your website. Upon delivery of an order, a customer must identify themselves with a valid identification document stating their date of birth. The following documents are accepted:

* Passport
* Dutch driving license
* European or Dutch ID card

Furthermore, we require the one-time submission of our merchant's declaration for alcoholic beverages. Download the form in your language of choice below, and e-mail a signed copy to <risk@multisafepay.com>
