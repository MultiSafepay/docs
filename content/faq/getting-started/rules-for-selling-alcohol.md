### Introduction

As of the 1st of July, you will be required to perform age verification during the _sale_ and the _delivery_ of an order that consists of alcohol. It is our duty as a Payment service provider to ensure that you comply with the legislation and that your customers meet the requirements when purchasing alcohol.

### Requirements

The law in the Netherlands states that alcohol cannot be sold to customers under the age of 18. As a merchant, it is mandatory to state this on clearly on your website. Upon delivery of an order, a customer must be able to identify themselves with a valid idenfication document stating their age in the form of a date of birth. The following documents are accepted:

* Passport
* Dutch driving license
* European or Dutch ID card

### Sales of spirits

If you are selling spirits that contain percentages of alcohol that are 15% or greater, you are required to provide us with a liquor license. You can send the liquor license to us by email at <example@multisafepay.com>
