It is possible to add an unlimited number of websites to your MultiSafepay Control. Please keep in mind that the websites added to your account must be operated by the same legal company for which your MultiSafepay Control was created.

If you wish to process payments for a website operated by a separate legal entity, you will have to sign up for an additional MultiSafepay Control.
