## Introduction

Onboarding refers to the steps required to activate a live account with MultiSafepay. When a [new account is created](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup), we perform several [Know your customer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) checks on the account holder, associated bank account, and the business. Furthermore, we examine the associated website, and the products offered to check whether they comply with our policies.

To allow you to process payments as quickly as possible, we divide the onboarding checks into two phases:

- **Identification**: Once we have established the identity of your account, you can start collecting payments from customers
- **Verification**: Once we have verified your identity, you can receive payouts on your business' bank account

* Information about the [ultimate beneficial owners](https://docs.multisafepay.com/faq/getting-started/guidance-notes-ultimate-beneficial-owner-form/) of the company, including color scans of valid identity documents. We advise you to use the [KopieID app](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/identiteitsfraude/vraag-en-antwoord/veilige-kopie-identiteitsbewijs) to hide personal information on passports or IDs.

### Product guidelines

We have compiled a list of products and services that can't be sold with MultiSafepay or can only be sold if additional requirements are met. The list is compiled based on applicable laws, risk factors, reputation impact and payment gateway policies. [Click here](/faq/getting-started/are-there-any-products-or-services-that-cannot-be-sold/) to read more and view the list.


_Please note that there is a possibility that your request to process credit cards will be denied, e.g., because a particular product category is not allowed by a processing bank._
