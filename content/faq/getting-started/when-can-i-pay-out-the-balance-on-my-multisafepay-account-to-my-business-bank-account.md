In order to pay out funds on your MultiSafepay Control to your business bank account, your MultiSafepay Control must be fully activated.

You can check this by logging in on [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)

1. Select _Pay-out_ from the Dashboard to the left
2. If your account is not fully activated, you will see a red bar at the top of the screen containing a link to the page where you may upload the documents necessary for the approval of your account.
