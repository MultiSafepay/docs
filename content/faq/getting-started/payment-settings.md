There are two ways to activate a payment method in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/), namely globally or at site level.

If you navigate to _Settings_ -> _Payment methods_, you can enable a payment method for all websites connected to your MultiSafepay Control (global setting) or, per individual website (site level). When choosing to enable a payment method at site level, it is important to enable all desired payment methods per individual site.

>_Please note: With every new payment method you want to add, it is important that said payment method is also enabled at site level._
