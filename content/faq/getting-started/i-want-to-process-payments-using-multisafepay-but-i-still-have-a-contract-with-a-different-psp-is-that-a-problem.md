No problem. At MultiSafepay, any applicable monthly fees will only be charged when your existing contract with your former Payment Service Provider has ended. You will have full access to all MultiSafepay features and prevent unnecessary costs. If you wish to know more about our switching service, please contact us via <sales@multisafepay.com>
