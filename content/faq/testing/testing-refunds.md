You can process full refunds in your [MultiSafepay Test Control](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/). However, partial refunds are not enabled by default. <br>

To enable partial refunds, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

If you refund a payment in your MultiSafepay Test Control, the transaction status remains __Reserved__ until the refund is manually approved, since there is no settlement with a bank.
