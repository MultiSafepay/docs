## Status change notification

The status of an order can change for many reasons. Payments being received or reversed and chargebacks are a few examples. Each time this happens, MultiSafepay will send a notification to your system with the transaction ID. The URL that MultiSafepay sends this notification to can be configured in two places. The first place checked is the request when initiating an order. If there is no Notification URL provided when initiating an order, the default Notification URL set in [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) will be used.

You can check within [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) to see if we were able to successfully connect and send a notification to your system in the Offline Actions section. This information can be seen in the MultiSafepay test environment and MultiSafepay Control:

1. Log into the MultiSafepay test environment or MultiSafepay Control.
2. Navigate to _Transactions_ â†’ _Transaction overview_.
3. Click on any transaction.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page to view the _Offline Actions_.

## Client system updates transaction status

Once your system receives a notification, it must retrieve the transaction status from MultiSafepay. The transaction status will clearly show whether a payment was successful or not and give a reason why a transaction was not successful.

After your system has updated the transaction or order status, you can verify that the information displayed is correct by comparing it to the information displayed within [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)
