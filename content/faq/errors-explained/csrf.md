CSRF, also known as Cross-Site Request Forgery.
 
The warning CSRF is displayed on our payment page when the customer is reaching it through a POST request.
This can occur when you are having an HTML form through which you send the customer to `https://payv2.multisafepay.com` with a POST request.
 
* `https://api.multisafepay.com` will accept POST and GET requests
* `https://payv2.multisafepay.com` will only accept GET requests.
 
If you are seeing this issue and are having difficulties resolving this error, do not hesitate to contact us at <integration@multisafepay.com>
