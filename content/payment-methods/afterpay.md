# User guide

### Addresses

Different billing and shipping addresses are supported.  
The **Transaction details** page in your dashboard only shows the billing address. To retrieve other details, see API reference â€“ [Get order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/getorder).

### Collection period
If the customer returns some items from the order and this takes a long time to verify, you can pauze the collection period for 2 to 4 weeks. 

Phone **+31 207 230 230** or email <merchant@afterpay.com> 

### Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and AfterPay, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. 

This is because AfterPay collects and require precise order specifications. Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.

### Shipment

When you ship the order, you **must** manually change the [order status](/payment-statuses/) from **completed** to **shipped** to:

- Capture the funds
- Trigger sending the invoice to the customer
- Prevent the order from expiring

<details id="how-to-change-order-status-to-shipped">
<summary>How to change order status to shipped</summary>
<br>

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
3. Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
4. Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
5. Change the status to **shipped**.
6. Send the customer the track and trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status in your backend, the following [ready-made integrations](/integrations/ready-made/) pass the updated status to your dashboard automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/updateorder) API request.

**Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.

</details>

### Surcharges  
Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/about-payments/surcharges/) to pay later methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM).  

AfterPay therefore strongly recommends discontinuing any surcharges.
