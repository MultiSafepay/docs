[AfterPay](https://www.afterpay.nl/en/) is a widely used <<glossary:BNPL>> method in the Netherlands and Belgium. Customers pay for orders after receiving them, and are only charged for items they keep from the order. AfterPay bears the risk and guarantees settlement.

# User guide

## Addresses

Different billing and shipping addresses are supported.  
The **Transaction details** page in your dashboard only shows the billing address. To retrieve other details, see API reference ‚Äì [Get order](/reference/getorder/).

## Collection period
If the customer returns some items from the order and this takes a long time to verify, you can pause the collection period for 2 to 4 weeks. 

Phone **+31 207 230 230** or email <merchant@afterpay.com> 

## Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and AfterPay, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. 

This is because AfterPay collects and require precise order specifications. Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.

## Shipment

When you ship the order, you **must** manually change the <<glossary:order status>> from **Completed** to **Shipped** to:

- Capture the funds
- Trigger sending the invoice to the customer
- Prevent the order from expiring

<details id="how-to-change-order-status-to-shipped">
<summary>How to change order status to shipped</summary>
<br>

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
3. Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
4. Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
5. Change the status to **Shipped**.
6. Send the customer the track and trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status in your <<glossary:backend>>, the following [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/) pass the updated status to your dashboard automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](/reference/updateorder/) API request.

**Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.

</details>

## Surcharges  
Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/docs/surcharges/) to <<glossary:BNPL>> methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM).  

AfterPay therefore strongly recommends discontinuing any surcharges. 

For more information, see AfterPay ‚Äì [Merchant support](https://www.afterpay.nl/nl/consumenten/vraag-en-antwoord/).
