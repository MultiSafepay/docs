# User guide

## Chargebacks

Customers can request a [chargeback](/docs/chargebacks/) within 56 days, or for unauthorized transactions (i.e. without verifiable consent from the customer) within 13 months. This makes direct debits unsuitable for most retail businesses, e.g.&nbsp;clothing.

You cannot dispute chargebacks and there is no facilitated process like there is for credit card chargebacks. Chargebacks can cost up to 65 EUR in bank fees.

## Declined transactions

If a direct debit is declined, a reason code is provided.

If the IBAN or BIC is incorrect, our bank informs us the next business day.

## E-mandates

An e-mandate represents an agreement between you and the customer and is required for every direct debit. We create them automatically based on the customer's IBAN and the `site_id`, and specify if it is a one-time, initial, or recurring debit (see [Recurring payments](/docs/recurring-payments)). 

E-mandates are needed when resolving customer disputes and [chargebacks](#chargebacks).

We send all e-mandates to our bank at the end of every business day. 

## Processing times

Transactions are processed within:

- Amounts less than 500 EUR: 9 days
- Amounts over 500 EUR: 22 days

Processing times can be reduced on request. Email <sales@multisafepay.com>

## Refund risk

There is a risk that if you refund a customer and they also request a chargeback, you pay their money back twice. Customers can even request a chargeback after successfully receiving a refund.

<details id="how-to-reduce-refund-risk">
<summary>How to reduce refund risks</summary>
<br>

To reduce the chances of this happening, we strongly recomend:

- Only processing refunds for trusted, verified customers.
- Avoiding refunding a customer if you have any ongoing dispute with them.
- If refunding:
    - First check if the customer has already requested a chargeback.
    - Wait until 7 working days after payment was initiated to be sure payment is now complete.
    - Communicate clearly to the customer that you are sending a refund and that the funds will take a few days to arrive in their account.
