Direct debits are a European banking method where customers authorize automatic one-off or recurring debits directly from their bank account. It is available in 36 countries and supports Sofort and iDEAL.

# User guide

## Chargebacks

Customers can request a [chargeback](/docs/chargebacks/) up to 56 days after their account has been debited. Following this, for a period extending up to 13 months, they can only initiate a chargeback with their bank if the transaction is considered unauthorized (e.g., made without verifiable customer consent).

In contrast to credit or debit card chargebacks, **you cannot dispute** Direct debit chargebacks.

Additionally, customers can initiate a chargeback even after receiving a refund if their bank hasn't registered it. This introduces a significant risk when issuing refunds during active customer disputes.

These chargebacks can result in bank fees of **up to 65 EUR**.

### Chargeback reasons

If you receive a chargeback, a reason code is provided.

If the IBAN or BIC is incorrect, our bank informs us the next business day.

## E-mandates

An e-mandate represents an agreement between you and the customer and is required for every direct debit. We create them automatically based on the customer's IBAN and the `site_id`, and specify if it is a one-time, initial, or recurring debit (see [Recurring payments](/docs/recurring-payments)).

E-mandates are needed when resolving customer disputes and [chargebacks](#chargebacks).

We send all e-mandates to our bank at the end of every business day.

## Processing times

Transactions are processed within:

* Amounts less than 500 EUR: 9 days
* Amounts over 500 EUR: 22 days

Processing times can be reduced on request. Email [sales@multisafepay.com](mailto:\[sales@multisafepay.com]\(mailto:sales@multisafepay.com\))

## Refund risk

You might end up paying twice the amount if a customer gets a refund from you and also files a chargeback, even if the chargeback is processed after the refund settled.

<details id="how-to-reduce-refund-risk">
  <summary>How to reduce refund risks</summary>

  <br />

  To reduce the chances of this happening, we strongly recommend:

  * Only processing refunds for trusted, verified customers.
  * Avoiding refunding a customer if you have any ongoing dispute with them.
  * If refunding:
    * First check if the customer has already requested a chargeback.
    * Wait until 7 working days after payment was initiated to be sure payment is now complete.
    * Communicate clearly to the customer that you are sending a refund and that the funds will take a few days to arrive in their account.
