[Betaal per Maand](https://www.santander.nl/veelgestelde-vragen/betaal-per-maand) is a MultiSafepay pay later method for large amounts in collaboration with Santander. Customers pay for orders after receiving them as a one-off payment or in monthly installments. 
They are only charged for the items they keep. Santander bears the risk and guarantees settlement.

# User guide

## Collection period

If the return process takes too long to verify, you can pause the collection period for 2â€“4 weeks. 

Have your Betaal per Maand client number ready, and email <klantenservice@santander.nl>

## Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and Betaal per Maand, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. 

This is because Santander collects and require precise order specifications. Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.

## Known error

The customer's first and last name, and the delivery details must be at least 2 characters long. Anything shorter can cause errors. 

We recommend always requiring full names, not initials, abbreviations, or acronyms.

## Shipment

### Changing orders before shipment

You can still change an order between approval from Santander and shipment.
