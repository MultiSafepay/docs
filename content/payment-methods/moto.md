Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO) is a MultiSafepay solution that lets you process card-not-present payments over the phone or by email. 

# How it works

The customer provides their card details to you over the phone or by email. 

Since MOTO skips [3D Secure](/docs/3ds2/) authentication, you bear the increased risk of fraud. To help ensure the customer is the cardholder, ask them to provide as much identifying information as possible, e.g.:

- Full name
- Address
- Phone numbers
- Email address
- Name of bank
- A copy of their signature on some correspondence, e.g. a scanned order confirmation

You handle the transaction via your MultiSafepay dashboard or our API. 

# Prerequisites

To handle MOTO transactions via our API, you must be PCI DSS compliant. 
See [Cardholder data](/docs/cardholder-data/).

# Activation
Email a request to activate MOTO to <sales@multisafepay.com>

The Risk Team assesses your request and, if approved, activates MOTO for your MultiSafepay account. 

Once activated, to process MOTO payments, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Mail & phone payments**.
3. Under **Order details**:  
    - From the **Currency** list, select the currency, and then fill out the **Amount** field.
    - From the **Site** list, select the relevant site. 
    - Optionally, in the **Order ID** field, enter an order ID.
    - In the **Description** text box, enter an order description.
4. Under **Credit card details**, enter the payment details provided by the customer by email or telephone. 
5. Under **Customer details**, enter the customer's name, address, and contact information. 
6. Click **Submit order**.  
The transaction appears in your **Transaction overview**.
