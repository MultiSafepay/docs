An online banking payment method of two of Belgium's largest banks: [CBC](https://www.cbc.be/particuliers/fr.html) which serves the French speaking population, and [KBC](https://www.kbc.be/particulieren/nl.html) which serves the Dutch-speaking population.

The payment method functions the same for both the CBC branch and the KBC branch. However, MultiSafepay's payment <<glossary:gateway>> includes the branches as separate options because customers of one branch can't pay through the other.
