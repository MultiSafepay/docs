An online banking payment method of two of Belgium's largest banks: <a href="https://www.cbc.be/particuliers/fr.html" target="_blank">CBC</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> which serves the French speaking population, and <a href="https://www.kbc.be/particulieren/nl.html" target="_blank">KBC</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> which serves the Dutch-speaking population.

The payment method functions the same for both the CBC branch and the KBC branch. However, MultiSafepay's payment <<glossary:gateway>> includes the branches as separate options because customers of one branch can't pay through the other.
