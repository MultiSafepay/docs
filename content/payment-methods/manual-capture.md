Manual Capture is a MultiSafepay solution that reduces your risk by letting you capture card payments either partially or in full when you ship the order. 

# How it works

**Full capture** is when a customer places an order but you are unable to ship it right away. An authorization is created for the full amount of the transaction. The funds are settled when you ship the order.

**Partial capture** is when a customer places an order for multiple items but you can't ship them all at once, only in separate shipments. An authorization is created for the full amount of the transaction, and the amount for each shipment is settled when you send it.

# Activation

To activate Manual Capture for your MultiSafepay account, email <sales@multisafepay.com>

# Integration

Manual Capture is supported for our [Magento 2](/docs/magento-2) integration.

To activate it in other [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/), you can customize it via our API.
