Manual Capture is a MultiSafepay solution that reduces your risk by letting you capture card payments either partially or in full when you ship the order.

# How it works

Applying **manual capture** to your orders authorizes the card payment but doesn't immediately transfer the customer's funds to your account. Using **manual capture**, you can **fully** or **partially** capture the authorized funds after shipping the order:

* **Full Capture**: Transfers the full authorized amount for the order.
* **Partial Capture**: Transfers a portion of the authorized amount for the order. Use this option for separate shipments.

# Activation

To activate Manual Capture for your MultiSafepay account, email [sales@multisafepay.com](mailto:sales@multisafepay.com)

# Integration

Manual Capture is supported for our [Magento 2](/docs/magento-2) integration.

To activate it in other [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/), you can customize it via our API.

<details id="cancel-authorization">
  <summary>How to capture an authorized payment</summary><br />

  1. Sign in to your MultiSafepay dashboard.
  2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**, and then click on the relevant transaction.
  3. On the **Transaction summary** page, under **Order summary**, click **Capture**:
     * **Full capture**: Fill the total authorized amount.
     * **Partial capture**: Fill the amount according to the items you will ship.
  4. Click **Save**.

  After a **full capture**, the <Glossary>transaction status</Glossary> updates to **Completed**.

  **Partial captures** create a new transaction in the **Transaction overview** with a separate **order ID**, with both <Glossary>order status</Glossary> and <Glossary>transaction status</Glossary> set to **Completed**. The original transaction retains its initial statuses. The remaining amount available for capture is shown under **Transaction details**.

## Cancellation

* Via your dashboard

For partial captures, the cancellation will apply to the remaining amount.
