Manual Capture is a MultiSafepay solution that reduces your risk by letting you capture credit card payments either partially or in full when you ship the order. 

# How it works

<details id="full-capture">
<summary>Full capture</summary>
<br>

Full capture is when a customer places an order but you are unable to ship it right away. An authorization is created for the full amount of the transaction. The funds are settled when you ship the order.

</details>

<details id="partial-capture">
<summary>Partial capture</summary>
<br>

Partial capture is when a customer places an order for multiple items but you can't ship them all at once, only in separate shipments. An authorization is created for the full amount of the transaction, and the amount for each shipment is settled when you send it.

</details>
