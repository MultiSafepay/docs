Manual Capture is a MultiSafepay solution that reduces your risk by letting you capture card payments either partially or in full when you ship the order. 

# How it works

Applying **manual capture** to your orders authorizes the card payment but doesn't immediately transfer the customer's funds to your account. Using **manual capture**, you can **fully** or **partially** capture the authorized funds after shipping the order:

- **Full Capture**: Transfers the full authorized amount for the order.
- **Partial Capture**: Transfers a portion of the authorized amount for the order. Use this option for separate shipments.

# Activation

To activate Manual Capture for your MultiSafepay account, email <sales@multisafepay.com>

# Integration

Manual Capture is supported for our [Magento 2](/docs/magento-2) integration.

To activate it in other [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/), you can customize it via our API.

# User guide

## Expiration periods

- VISA: 7 days
- Mastercard and Maestro: 30 days

## Payment methods

- Maestro 
- Mastercard

## Capture payments

You can capture payments:

- Via our API - [Capture payment](https://docs.multisafepay.com/reference/capturepayment) 
- Via your dashboard

<details id="cancel-authorization">
<summary>How to capture an authorized payment</summary><br>

1. Sign in to your MultiSafepay dashboard.
2. Go to **Transactions **> **Transactions overview**, and then click on the relevant transaction.
3. On the **Transaction summary** page, under **Order summary**, click **Capture**:
   - **Full capture**: Fill the total authorized amount. 
   - **Partial capture**: Fill the amount according to the items you will ship.
4. Click **Save**.

After a **full capture**, the <<glossary:transaction status>> updates to **Completed**. 

**Partial captures** create a new transaction in the **Transaction overview** with a separate **order ID**, with both <<glossary:order status>> and <<glossary:transaction status>> set to **Completed**. The original transaction retains its initial statuses. The remaining amount available for capture is shown under **Transaction details**. 

</details>

## Cancellation

You can cancel a reservation created via manual capture:

- Via our API - [Cancel authorized payment](https://docs.multisafepay.com/reference/capturepayment)
- Via your dashboard 

For partial captures, the cancellation will apply to the remaining amount.
