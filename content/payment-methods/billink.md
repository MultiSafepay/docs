## Amount limits

## Cancellation

You can cancel the invoice order **before** shipment or **after** partial shipment.

<details id="how-to-cancel-an-order">
<summary>How to cancel an order</summary>
<br>

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.

</details>

## Collection flow

- Billink sends the customer an invoice after the order is shipped in full, **or** partially shipped and the remaining items cancelled. 
- If the customer fails to pay within the initial 14 day period, Billink sends reminders of their obligation to pay, in accordance with the Wet Incasso Kosten (WIK). 
- The customer can contact Billink if there is an issue with the payment.
- If the customer still fails to pay, Billink sends the invoice to a debt collector. 
- If necessary, you can delay the collection flow by placing the transaction on hold.

## Refunds

To refund a Billink transaction, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
2. Navigate to **Transactions / Transactions Overview** and find the transaction you want to refund, or search for the transaction you want to refund by using the search bar.
3. Click on the transaction to go to the transaction details page.
4. On the right side of the page are the order details and a blue Refund button.
5. In this section you can remove order lines or refund the complete order.

## Shipment

When you ship the order, you **must** manually change the [order status](/docs/payment-statuses/) from **Completed** to **Shipped**, which:

- Captures the funds
- Prevents the order from expiring

<details id="how-to-change-order-status-to-shipped">
<summary>How to change the order status to shipped</summary>
<br>

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**, and then click the relevant transaction.
3. On the **Transaction details** page, under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
4. Change the status to **Shipped**.
5. Send the customer the track and trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status in your backend, the following [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/) pass the updated status to your dashboard automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](/reference/updateorder/) API request.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.

### Surcharges

Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/docs/surcharges/) to <<glossary:BNPL>> methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM).  

We therefore strongly recommend **not** applying surcharges.
