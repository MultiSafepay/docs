It supports American Express, Maestro, Mastercard, Visa, and Dutch bank accounts. Customers can make both online and near-field communication (NFC) payments. 

An additional layer of security is provided by 3D Secure, which requires customers to verify their identity.

  If a customer uses an unsupported device to navigate to an Apple Pay payment page, they won't be able to complete the payment. To prevent this, before creating the payment page, check whether Apple Pay is supported on the customer's device.

  ```javascript
  try {
      if (window.ApplePaySession && ApplePaySession.canMakePayments()) {
      console.log('Apple Pay available');
      // Create an Apple Pay payment page from your server
      }
      } catch (error) {
      console.debug('An error occurred while verifying if Apple Pay is available:', error);
      }
  ```

# User guide

## Gateways

American Express, Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa <<glossary:gateways>> are supported. 

## Known errors

For most of our ready-made integrations, if the customer uses an incompatible device, Apple Pay doesn't appear on the checkout page. 

For our [OpenCart plugin](/docs/opencart/), Apple Pay does appear on the checkout page on incompatible devices, but throws an error when clicked and the payment button is disabled.
