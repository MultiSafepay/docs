This page lists card error codes you may encounter in authentication and authorization responses or statuses and descriptions.

**Authentication errors** occur when the person introducing the card details cannot demonstrate that they are the cardholder. Authentication errors can be either technical or non-technical, for example 3DS code inserted incorrectly.
**Authorization errors** occur when the issuer bank, schemes or other intermediates reject the authorization (this is possible for both 3DS-verified and non-verified transactions).

## Authentication errors

This table lists the most common 3DS authentication failed errors response and descriptions.

In these cases, neither MultiSafepay nor the merchant can take specific actions to unblock the transaction. Advise the cardholder to contact their bank if the reason for the error is unclear to them.
