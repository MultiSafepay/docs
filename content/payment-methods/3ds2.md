3D Secure 2.0 (3DS2) is an authentication protocol card schemes use to verify cardholder identity for online credit and debit card payments. Under the [PSD2](/payment-regulations/psd2/), MultiSafepay is required to apply it to **all** Europe-based card payments, and we enable it by default for non-EU payments as well. 

3DS2 provides an extra layer of security and helps reduce fraud-related [chargebacks](/chargebacks/). If a transaction is successfully authenticated using 3DS2, the card scheme is responsible for chargeback costs instead of you.

# How it works

1. The cardholder enters their payment details and is redirected to the card scheme to authenticate using their branded version of 3DS2: 
    - American Express Safekey
    - Mastercard SecureCode
    - Verified by Visa
2. Contextual information from the customer's device (fingerprint) is shared with you and the scheme to conduct a risk assessment, e.g.:
    - Transaction value
    - New or existing customer
    - Customer's location and/or transaction history
3. You and the scheme each decide whether to request additional authentication:
    - **Frictionless flow:** The transaction appears legitimate and is authorized without further user-side authentication. 
    - **Challenge flow:** The transaction appears risky and the cardholder is asked to provide additional authentication, e.g. password, SMS code, fingerprint.


# Exemptions

To help you optimize conversion and manage risk, MultiSafepay supports exemptions from 3DS2 and [strong customer authentication](/payment-regulations/psd2/) (SCA). Under the PSD2, some exemptions are only supported **outside** of Europe.

> ðŸš§ Warning
>
> Exemptions remove an important layer of security and increase the risk of fraud. 
> You are then liable for any fraud-related chargebacks. 

### Merchant-initiated transactions

Merchant-initiated transactions (MIT) are [recurring payments](/recurring-payments) you initiate on the customer's behalf, based on a prior agreement, e.g. subscriptions, automatic balance top-ups. 
3DS2 authentication is **not** required.


### Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO)
 
For [MOTO](/cards/moto/) payments, the customer gives you their card details by phone or email. 
3DS2 authentication is **not required**. 

### Transaction risk analysis

MultiSafepay can conduct a transaction risk analysis (TRA) for specific transactions for amounts up to EUR&nbsp;500. The issuer may soft decline the exemption, in which case the customer is automatically redirected to authenticate.
