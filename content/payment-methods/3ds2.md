# Authentication

3D Secure 2 (3DS2) is an authentication protocol that <<glossary:card schemes>> use to verify cardholder identity for online credit and debit card payments. Under the [PSD2](/docs/psd2/), MultiSafepay is required to apply it to **all** Europe-based card payments, and we enable it by default for non-EU payments as well. 

3DS2 provides an extra layer of security and helps reduce fraud-related [chargebacks](/docs/chargebacks/). If a transaction is successfully authenticated using 3DS2, the issuer is responsible for fraud-related chargeback costs instead of you.

## How it works

1. The cardholder enters their payment details and is redirected to the card scheme to authenticate using their branded version of 3DS2: 
   - American Express Safekey
   - Mastercard SecureCode
   - Verified by Visa
2. MultiSafepay shares contextual information from the customer's device (fingerprint) with the issuer for a risk assessment, e.g.:
   - Transaction value
   - New or existing customer
   - Customer's location or transaction history
3. The issuer decides whether to request additional authentication:
   - **Frictionless flow:** The transaction appears legitimate and is authorized without further user-side authentication. You are not liable for fraud-related chargebacks.
   - **Challenge flow:** The transaction appears risky, and the cardholder is asked to provide additional authentication, e.g., password, SMS code, and fingerprint.

# Direct card payments

When you collect cardholder data, you also need to collect other contextual information from the customer's device (fingerprint). This is only relevant for `direct` card orders and **not** for [payment components](/docs/payment-components) or [payment pages](/docs/payment-pages), where MultiSafepay collects the fingerprint on your behalf.

See also [Cardholder data](/docs/cardholder-data).

# Exemptions

To help you optimize <<glossary:conversion>> and manage risk, MultiSafepay supports exemptions from 3DS2 and [strong customer authentication](/docs/psd2/) (SCA). <!--Under the PSD2, some exemptions are only supported outside of Europe.-->

> ⚠️ Warning
> 
> Exemptions remove an important layer of security and increase the risk of fraud.  
> You are then liable for any fraud-related chargebacks.

## Low value payments

We will soon support exemptions for low value payments (LVP) under 30 EUR.

## Secure corporate payments

SCA authentication is **not** required for corporate card payments made with commercial cards.

## Transaction risk analysis

MultiSafepay can conduct a transaction risk analysis (TRA) for specific transactions for amounts up to EUR 500. The <<glossary:issuer>> may soft decline the exemption, in which case the customer is automatically redirected to authenticate. 

- **Scope:** All EU and non-EU cards
- **Pricing:** Free

# Out of scope

## Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO)

For [MOTO](/docs/moto/) payments, the customer gives you their card details by phone or email.  
3DS2 authentication is **not** required.

## Recurring payments

For [recurring payments](/docs/recurring-payments), 3DS2 or SCA authentication is required only for the initial payment transaction.
