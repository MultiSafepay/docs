excerpt: 'A pricing model used by banks and card schemes.'
slug: interchange
---

Banks and <<glossary:card schemes>> all charge different fees to cover the operational costs of managing their network and processing credit card payments.

There are three cost components for the Interchange++ model:

- The Interchange fee that is paid to the issuing bank
- The scheme fee charged by Visa or Mastercard
- The <<glossary:acquirer>> fee 

These costs vary considerably depending on a range of factors, including the:

- Merchant's country
- Issuing bank 
- Cardholder 
- Merchant segment
- Monthly transaction volume 

When you create a MultiSafepay account, we provide an estimate of these costs.

### Specific transaction costs

The actual cost of a specific transaction is difficult to predict. Fees differ per transaction, based on factors such as the:

- Country where the card was issued
- Country where the transaction is processed
- Type of card, e.g. corporate or customer card
- Way the card is processed, e.g. level of security
- Amount of the transaction

To ensure transparency, payment service providers can choose the Interchange++ pricing model, which breaks down the costs for each transaction. There are no preset prices, instead the fee is calculated based on the total cost of all transactions processed.
