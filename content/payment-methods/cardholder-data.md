---
When you accept credit and debit card payments using a [payment page](/payment-pages/) or [payment component](/payment-components/), MultiSafepay handles the sensitive cardholder data, including:

- Primary account number (PAN)
- Cardholder name
- Service code
- Expiry date

We bear the risk and responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/payment-regulations/pci-dss/). 

Alternatively, you can collect cardholder data through other means. Because you will then handle sensitive data on your own server before sending it to MultiSafepay, you must also have PCI DSS certification. 

You are responsible for arranging certification, which is a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process. Consider carefully if this makes sense for your business model.
