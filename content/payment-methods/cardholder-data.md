  excerpt: Handle sensitive cardholder data on your PCI DSS compliant server.
---
When you accept credit and debit card payments using a [payment page](/docs/payment-pages/) or [payment component](/docs/payment-components/), MultiSafepay handles the sensitive cardholder data, including:

* Primary account number (PAN)
* Cardholder name
* Service code
* Expiry date

We bear the risk and responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/docs/pci-dss/).

Alternatively, you can collect cardholder data through other means. Because you will then handle sensitive data on your own server before sending it to MultiSafepay, you must also have PCI DSS certification.

You are responsible for arranging certification, which is a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process. Consider carefully if this makes sense for your business model.

# Activation

   * The type of products you will sell
   * Your average order values and volumes, and any available processing statements.
2. We check your account and company performance.

# Integration

See API reference ‚Äì [Create order](/reference/createorder/) > Card order.\
Set `type` to `direct`.

## 3DS2

When you collect cardholder data, you must also collect the contextual information about the customer's device (fingerprint) required for [3DS2](/docs/3ds2) authentication. The fingerprint can be created through JavaScript interfaces and methods in the customer's browser.\
**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Some details are required to comply with scheme regulations. For example, transactions created with payment method VISA must include correct information in the `email` or `phone` parameter.

To learn how to create a fingerprint, see Recipe ‚Äì <a href="https://docs.multisafepay.com/recipes/create-a-customerbrowser-object" target="_blank">Create a customer.browser object</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style={{ fontSize: "12px", color: "#8b929e" }}></i> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style={{ fontSize: "12px", color: "#8b929e" }} />.
