## Testing a gift card
There is no test data available or provided by the issuer of the gift card to test a gift card in a staging or test environment.

When a gift card has been activated on the ecommerce platform, a (small) transaction can be completed to check whether the connection is set correctly to process the gift card as payment method.

>_Note that this is a real payment and the specified amount will be deducted from the gift card_.
