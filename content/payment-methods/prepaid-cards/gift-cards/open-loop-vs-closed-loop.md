## Open-loop vs. Closed-loop

There are two types of gift cards available at MultiSafepay, these are _Open-loop_ and _Closed-loop_. The main difference between the two cards is that [Open-loop gift cards](/faq/general/glossary/#open-loop-gift-card) can be redeemed at a wide variety of merchants such as clothing stores, resturants and grocery stores, whereas [Closed-loop gift cards](/faq/general/glossary/#closed-loop-gift-card) can only be used at a single merchant.

It must be noted that customers can redeem multiple Open-loop gift cards to the maximum amount of â‚¬50. Once this value has been reached, you can only pay with a closed-loop gift card or another payment method.

From now, these conditions only apply to Open-loop cards. These new laws and regulations do not apply to Closed-loop (such as your own gift card via GivaCard or retailer-specific cards). Gift cards that are for a limited group or category, such as the National Cinema Coupon, are also exempt from the limits.
