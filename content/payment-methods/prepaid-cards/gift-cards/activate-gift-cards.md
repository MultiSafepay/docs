# Activate
MultiSafepay supports a wide range of gift cards.
With gift cards, merchants can either accept gift card payments of established gift card issuers or support their own personalized gift card.

MultiSafepay offers 3 gift card connections:

* Intersolve
* FashionCheque
* 123TCS.

The majority of the gift cards are issued by Intersolve.

### Where to start?

1. Select a gift card
2. Check for compatibility with your ecommerce platform and MultiSafepay
3. Start the application procedure with the issuer of the gift card
4. Provide the issuer of the gift card with your company details and your MultiSafepay account ID
5. As soon as the issuer of the gift card has processed their part of the activation, MultiSafepay will receive the connect settings to enable the gift card
6. Finalize the implementation of the gift card by activating the gift card on the ecommerce platform.


### Multiple gift cards
Multiple gift cards are supported by MultiSafepay.
The customer can pay an order with multiple gift cards of the same or multiple different gift cards.

### Contact details
The gift card issuer will process the connection with one of the issuers shown below. The request for a gift card goes through the issuer of the gift card itself. For example: the VVV Cadeaukaart can be requested at the VVV office. Subsequently, the connection of the VVV Cadeaukaart will be processed by Intersolve in this case.
