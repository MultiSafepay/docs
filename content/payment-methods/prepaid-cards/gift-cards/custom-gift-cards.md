We can develop custom gift cards. For example:

- [Intersolve](https://intersolve.nl)
- [123TCS](https://www.123tcs.com) 
- [Klantkaart](https://www.klantkaart.nl)

To apply for a custom gift card, email your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com> 

We then:

- Check the product rules for the relevant payment method. 
- Assess the feasibility of and timeframe for developing the custom gift card.
- Request from you:

    - The name of your gift card
    - A high-resolution visual mockup of the gift card, preferably in .png or .jpg format, showing the logo as **large** as possible
    - A test gift card with credit and a secure code
    - A startup fee of 200 EUR

## Integrating custom gift cards

For more information about processing gift card transactions, see API Reference â€“ [Gift cards](/api/#gift-card).

For support, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

### MultiSafepay integrations

You cannot add custom gift cards as a standard payment method in [MultiSafepay ecommerce integrations](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations/). You need to add the gift card in your backend. For assistance, ask your developer.

You can start processing payments with the gift card as soon as we release it.

### Custom integrations

If you have a custom integration, you are responsible for integrating the gift card, using the [generic gateway code](/faq/general/generic-gateways/) we provide.
