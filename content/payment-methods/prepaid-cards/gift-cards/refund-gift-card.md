## Request refund
If a refund of a gift card payment has been requested, you could do so through your own banking environment, as follows:

* A transaction fully paid with a gift card can not be reimbursed through MultiSafepay, due to missing bank account details of the customer

* A transcation partially paid with a gift card and partially paid with a different method (e.g. iDEAL), can be fully reimbursed to the customer

The amount deducted from a gift card to pay an order is not processed or received by MultiSafepay. MultiSafepay only receives a status notification of a successful payment.

The payout is entirely provided by the issuer of the gift card.
