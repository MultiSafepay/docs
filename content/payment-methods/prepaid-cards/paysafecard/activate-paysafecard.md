1. When buying your Paysafecard PIN, choose 10, 25, 50 or 100 EUR
2. The value of the PIN code is immediately and entirely at your disposal
3. If you do not fully use the value of a PIN when you pay, the residual credit will remain available for you to use later
4. If you have not used up the balance in the first 12 months, then from the 13th month, you will be charged a monthly administration fee of 3 EUR of the residual balance.
