{{< details title="Paysafecard refund rules" >}}

- You can [refund more than original amount](/faq/finance/refund-more-than-original-amount).

- There is no time limit on refunding successful transactions, so long as the receiving bank can process the refund.

{{< /details >}}

**Note:** MultiSafepay does not process or collect the funds deducted from Paysafecard vouchers to complete payments.

- Transactions paid with Paysafecard in full can't be refunded through MultiSafepay because we don't receive any payment details or bank account details from the customer. You can process refunds in your own online banking environment. 

- Transcations paid with Paysafecard and another payment method (e.g. iDEAL) can be refunded in full.
