# User guide

## Addresses

Different billing and shipping addresses are supported.  
The **Transaction details** page in your dashboard only shows the billing address. To retrieve other details, see API reference ‚Äì [Get order](/reference/getorder/).

## Collection period
If the customer returns some items from the order and this takes a long time to verify, you can pause the collection period for 2 to 4 weeks. 

Phone **+31 207 230 230** or email <merchant@afterpay.com> 

## Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and Riverty, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. 

This is because Riverty collects and require precise order specifications. Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.

## Shipment

When you ship the order, you **must** manually change the <<glossary:order status>> from **Completed** to **Shipped** to:

- Capture the funds
- Trigger sending the invoice to the customer
- Prevent the order from expiring

<details id="how-to-change-order-status-to-shipped">
<summary>How to change order status to shipped</summary>
<br>

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**, and then click the relevant transaction.
3. On the **Transaction details** page, under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
4. Change the status to **Shipped**.
5. Send the customer the track and trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status in your <<glossary:backend>>, the following [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/) pass the updated status to your dashboard automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](/reference/updateorder/) API request.

‚ùóÔ∏è **Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.

</details>

## Surcharges  
Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/docs/surcharges/) to <<glossary:BNPL>> methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM).  

Riverty therefore strongly recommends discontinuing any surcharges. 

For more information, see Riverty ‚Äì <a href="https://www.afterpay.nl/nl/consumenten/vraag-en-antwoord/" target="_blank">Merchant support</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
