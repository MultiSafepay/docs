## Issuer fees

The customer's bank may apply their own fee to MyBank transactions (not influenced by MultiSafepay or MyBank). This can have a significant impact on transactions for small amounts, e.g. 1 EUR transaction, but a 1,50 EUR issuer fee.

> **Tip!** Consider setting a minimum amount limit for MyBank transactions in your integration.
