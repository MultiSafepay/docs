## Issuer fees

The customer's bank may apply their own fee to MyBank transactions (not influenced by MultiSafepay or MyBank).\
This can have a significant impact on transactions for small amounts (e.g., a 1 EUR transaction but with a 1.50 EUR issuer fee).

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Consider setting a minimum amount limit for MyBank transactions in your integration.
