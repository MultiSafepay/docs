<summary>About credit and debit cards</summary>
<br>

Cards are issued by a bank, building society, or <<glossary:card scheme>> and let customers pay on credit. Debit cards are issued by a bank and let customers transfer funds directly from their bank account. Cardholders can pay for products or services at a point of sale, online, or on a mobile app. They can also withdraw cash, or link their card to digital wallets or other local payment methods.

Cards are a very common payment method in many countries. Their widespread acceptance, ease of use, and ability to process payments in multiple currencies make them the ideal choice for many customers.

Cards may feature:

- A card number to uniquely identify the card
- A 3-4 digit card verification code (CVC) for additional security
- An expiry date 
- The cardholder's name

# Integration

### API
- See API reference ‚Äì [Create order](/reference/createorder/) > Card order.

  <details id="example-requests"> 
  <summary>Example requests</summary>
  <br>

  For example requests, on the [Create order](/reference/createorder/) page, in the black sandbox, see **Examples** > **Card direct/redirect**. Set `gateway` to `AMEX`, `MAESTRO`, `MASTERCARD`, `VISA`, or the generic `CREDITCARD`.

  **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Consider card-specific requirements for the [Create order request](/reference/createorder/), for example including correct details in the `email` or `phone` parameter for VISA payments. 

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MultiSafepay/docs/master/static/img/APIExamples.png" align ="center"/>

  </details>

- Transactions expire after 1 hour.

#### Co-branded cards
Co-branded cards are processed through the `VISA` <<glossary:gateway>>. 
In the `customer` object, set the `locale` parameter: 
- Cartes Bancaires: `fr_FR` (France) 
- Dankort: `da_DK` (Denmark) 
- Postepay: `it_IT` (Italy) 

#### Generic gateway
- The generic `CREDITCARD` gateway bundles all cards activated for your account into a single gateway to save space in your checkout. The [payment page](/docs/payment-pages/) automatically detects the specific card scheme based on the first 4 digits of the card number the customer enters. 
- See Examples > Card payment redirect. 

### Ready-made integrations
All our [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/) support: 
- Amex, Maestro, Mastercard (<<glossary:redirect>>) 
- Visa (including Cartes Bancaires, Dankort, Postepay, V Pay) (<<glossary:redirect>>)
