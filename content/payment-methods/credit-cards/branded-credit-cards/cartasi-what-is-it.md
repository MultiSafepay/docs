# CartaSi
## What is CartaSi
CartaSi - a Visa or Mastercard co-branded product - is one of the best-known and most commonly used Italian credit cards. Every credit card with the 'Verified by Visa' or 'MasterCard SecureCode' logo can be safely used for online payments.

## How CartaSi works
CartaSi payments are processed through the Visa or Mastercard gateway.

## How to activate CartaSi?
For CartaSi to be available as a payment method on the payment page of MultiSafepay, the following are required:

1. The Visa or Mastercard gateway needs to be enabled
2. The locale needs to be it_IT (Italy) in the transaction call received by MultiSafepay.

The [locale](/faq/api/locale/) is leading in this to show the desired payment method CartaSi on the payment page of MultiSafepay.

Upon adding CartaSi as payment method on the checkout page, you can download the CartaSi logo from MultiSafepay's [collection](/faq/general/payment-method-logo/) and upload it to your ecommerce platform. 

## How to refund a CartaSi transaction?

CartaSi transactions can be refunded to the customer within 180 days.

Please follow these steps to refund a CartaSi transaction:

1. Login into your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction -> transaction_
3. Find the transaction through search

> Please note that credit card payments that are refunded by the merchant to the customer, will be sent to the card issuing bank and its partners within 1 business day by MultiSafepay. Whether or not the refund will be visible to the customer depends on the reports, statements and online tools that are made available by the issuing bank_.
