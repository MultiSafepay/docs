## Declined
If a credit card payment of a customer receives the status _declined_, it may be for several reasons. Only the customer can contact their credit card issuer to inquire as to why the credit card payment has been _declined_.

For questions about credit card payments and/or a payment status (of a credit card transaction), please contact us at <support@multisafepay.com>

In most cases the declined reason is shown behind the declined status within the transaction in your MultiSafepay Control.
