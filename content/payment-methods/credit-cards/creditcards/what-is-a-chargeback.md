# Chargeback
Customers who disagree with or do not recognise a transaction that is charged to their credit card can ask the card issuing bank to raise a dispute. If a dispute is raised, the card scheme (e.g. Mastercard or Visa) will notify MultiSafepay and reclaim the transaction amount from the merchant.

A cardholder can claim a chargeback for a minimum of 180 days after the purchase based on their customer rights given by the card scheme (Visa, Mastercard or American Express).

For more information about chargebacks, please visit our [chargeback documentation](/payment-methods/creditcards/chargebacks/).
