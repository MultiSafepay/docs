# Activate
With MultiSafepay, Visa and Mastercard are additional (non-standard) payment method. You can submit the application to activate the payment methods through your account manager via <sales@multisafepay.com>

To activate Visa and Mastercard as payment methods for your webshop, we would like to receive the following information from you:

- Average transaction amount
- Minimum transaction amount
- Maximum transaction amount
- Yearly turnover by credit cards.

When approved by our Risk Team, Visa and Mastercard will be enabled in your MultiSafepay Control as payment methods.

> By default, American Express is not activated when enabling Visa and Mastercard. Would you also like to be able to process American Express transactions? Please let us know by submitting your request at <sales@multisafepay.com>
