## Request refund 
The refund of a Visa, Mastercard or American Express transaction can be processed from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com). 

* A credit card payment can be refunded within 180 days. After this period, it is advised to process the requested refund through a bank transfer.

* In order to minimize the risk of a double refund of the original amount, a refund is not possible when a chargeback is attached to the transaction. 

Please follow these steps:

1. Select _Transactions -> Transaction overview_
2. Find the transaction through search
3. Open the transaction
4. Select _refund_
5. Fill in the amount that you are going to refund to the customer
6. _Confirm_.


* The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day.

* Refunding more than the stated amount of the original transaction is NOT possible with credit cards. More information is available on our [refund more than original amount](/faq/finance/refund-more-than-original-amount/) page

> A refund will be processed the next business day. However, depending an the issuer, it is possible that the amount is not shown directly on the card. If this is the case, we recommend contacting the issuer of your credit card. If an ARN is needed, the support department is able to provide one. 

A refund will only be processed if your balance on your MultiSafepay Control is positive.
