## American Express, additional information 
American Express is protected by its own branded 3D secure, the American Express Safekey. All transactions processed via this payment method are verified through the Safekey. 

> Should this be something of interest for you, the only allowed exception from mandatory Safekey verification is for for transactions lower than 30 EUR. This rule can be configured via the [3D Dynamic tool](/tools/server2server/3d-dynamics/).


Credit card payments are not fully guaranteed. Customers can withdraw the transaction, due to their customer right protection of the credit card schemes. The accountability​ of accepting credit card payments lies entirely with the Merchant.

> When using an own MID (MerchantID) from American Express, the funds are not processed by MultiSafepay. Instead, they will be added to your own balance at American Express.

> Moreover, when requesting an own MID (MerchantID) from American Express, you will be automatically added to the Safekey directory. For existing customers, American Express has retroactively enabled this feature. For more information, please contact the support team at <support@multisafepay.com> 

Credit card payments are not fully guaranteed. Customers can withdraw the transaction, due to their customer right protection of VISA and Mastercard. The accountability​ of accepting credit card payments lies entirely with the Merchant. 

> American Express is a premium product and falls in a different category than Visa and Mastercard. This is why American Express requires a separate application with MultiSafepay.
