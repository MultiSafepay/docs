Request to Pay is a Deutsche Bank payment method based on the PSD2 Open Banking API. Customers are redirected to Deutsche Bank online banking to authenticate themselves, and authorize a secure SEPA transfer. Settlement is instant (if supported) or within 24 hours. 

The funds are transferred directly to your business bank account, instead of your MultiSafepay balance, which simplifies reconciliation.

:warning: Request to Pay is currently not available to new merchants. It is still supported for existing merchants.
