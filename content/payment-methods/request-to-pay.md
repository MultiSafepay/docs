Request to Pay is a Deutsche Bank payment method based on the PSD2 Open Banking API. Customers are redirected to Deutsche Bank online banking to authenticate themselves, and authorize a secure SEPA transfer. <<glossary:Settlement>> is instant (if supported) or within 24 hours. 

The funds are transferred directly to your business bank account, instead of your account balance, which simplifies reconciliation.
