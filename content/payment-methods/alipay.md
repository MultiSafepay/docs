[Alipay](https://global.alipay.com/platform/site/ihome) is a leading global payment method that lets Chinese customers link their credit card or bank account to a digital wallet. It supports online, QR, and contactless POS payments, as well as international money transfers.

For Chinese customers, Alipay accounts are verified and linked to their Chinese bank account. Since 2021, non-Chinese customers can also pay with Alipay using the Tour Pass.
