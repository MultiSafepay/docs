[Bancontact](https://www.bancontact.com/en) is a leading Belgian payment method that supports online, mobile, QR, POS, and wallet payments. It is a household name and supported by over 80% of Belgian webshops. Once payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it and Bancontact guarantees settlement.

# Bancontact WIP Service

Bancontact WIP is a wallet initiated payment service you can use for:

- Bancontact One-Click Pay: customer-initiated one-click payments to make checkout faster and increase conversion
- Bancontact Recurring: merchant-initiated subscription payments

## How it works

Bancontact Payconiq gives you access to a merchant wallet to securely store customers' payment details in. Customers give one-time consent and only need to pass [strong customer authentication](/pds2/) (SCA) for their first purchase. 

There is no shift in liability for [chargebacks](/chargebacks/) from issuer to acquirer since your fraud and disputes volumes are monitored quarterly. A maximum transaction amount applies. 

## Activation and criteria

- Bancontact WIP is only available to low-risk, high-volume merchants (25,000 transactions quarterly), within the SEPA area. 
- Applies to services only, not physical products. 
- You must have easy-to-use procedures in place for refunds, cancellations, and disputes.
- Customers must be able to add, update, and delete their stored payment details.  
- You must be able to continually demonstrate low rates of fraudulent transactions, or access to your merchant wallet may be revoked. 

Email a request to activate Bancontact WIP to <sales@multisafepay.com>

Requests are screened and approved by Bancontact Payconiq.
