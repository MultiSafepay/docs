## What you need to do

Check your integration. If you use a:

- Direct integration, you need to remove ING Homeâ€™Pay from your checkout yourself. 
- Redirect (hosted) integration, you donâ€™t need to do anything. Weâ€™ll take care of this for you. 

## Alternative payment methods

[Bancontact](/payment-methods/bancontact/), Belgiumâ€™s leading payment method, is an excellent option to continue attracting Belgian customers. Other popular local alternatives are [Belfius](/payment-methods/belfius/) or [CBC/KBC](/payment-methods/cbc-kbc/).
