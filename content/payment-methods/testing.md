Before you start processing real transactions with MultiSafepay, we recommend testing each payment method in your <a href="https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/" target="_blank">MultiSafepay test account</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.

# Credentials

For all payment methods **except** AfterPay, you need your site's test [API key](/docs/sites#site-id-api-key-and-security-code).

# How to make a test payment

1. Initiate a payment:  

    <details id="in-your-ready-made-integration">
    <summary>In your ready-made integration</summary>
    <br>

    - In your <<glossary:backend>>, enter your test site [API key](/docs/sites#site-id-api-key-and-security-code).
    - Place a test order, and then initiate a transaction with the payment method you are testing. 
    
    <br>

    </details>
    <details id="via-our-api">
    <summary>Via our API</summary>
    <br>
  
    - [Create an order](/reference/createorder/) via our API to the test endpoint: `https://testapi.multisafepay.com/v1/json/` 
    - For example requests for specific payment methods, see **Examples**.

    <br>

    </details>
2. Enter the [test payment details](/docs/testing#test-payment-details) for the payment method you are testing, or select a payment scenario.
3. Complete the test payment.
4. To check the transaction details, sign in to your <a href="https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/" target="_blank">test dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
5. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**, and then click the relevant transaction.
6. On the **Transaction details** page, under **Offline actions**, to see if you have succesfully connected to our system, check that you've correctly received the **notifyMerchantTrans** action.  
    For information about errors, see [HTTP errors](/docs/http-errors/).

> âœ… Success!
> Once your live account is approved, make sure you use the site API key from your **live** account instead of your test account.

<summary>How to test Apple Pay</summary>
<br>

**Compatible devices**

For compatible devices, see Apple â€“ <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208531" target="_blank">Devices compatible with Apple Pay</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.

If you don't own an Apple device, we recommend using the <a href="https://appetize.io" target="_blank">Appetize.io</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> emulator. When you try to complete a test payment on the payment page, you get a _This device is not supported_ error. But the emulator creates an order with the Apple Pay <<glossary:gateway>> pre-selected to check if there is an existing connection to our server. However, you can't fully complete the test transaction.

**Prerequisites**

- Use a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208531" target="_blank">compatible device</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>
- Use Safari browser
- Activate Maestro for your MultiSafepay account

If these requirements are not met, Apple Pay doesn't appear on the checkout page.

**Testing Apple Pay redirect**

To test your Apple Pay redirect integration, there are two ways:

- If you have an Apple account with at least one credit card in your wallet, you can use your own account and card details in our test environment without incurring any costs.
- Alternatively, you can use an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/sandbox-testing" target="_blank">Apple Developer account</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> configured for Apple Pay, with at least one Apple Pay test card in your wallet.

To test, follow these steps:

1. [Create an order](/reference/createorder/) > Wallet order  
    Example: Apple Pay redirect
2. On the payment page, click the **Apple Pay** button.  
    You can ignore the "This device is not supported" error.
3. Sign in to your Apple Developer account and select your test card.
4. Authorize the payment.
  The transaction is completed.

**Testing Apple Pay direct**

See Apple Pay direct integration â€“ [Test your integration](/docs/apple-pay-integration#6-test-your-integration).

</details>

<details id="google-pay">
<summary>How to test Google Pay</summary>
<br>

To test Google Pay payments, follow these steps:

1. In your checkout, click the **Google Pay** button.  
2. Complete payment using your Google account. 

    Your real card details are never processed in our testing environment, but you must add at least one chargeable card to your Google account.

    Depending on your card's authentication method, you may or may not be redirected to authenticate:

    - **PAN only**: Authentication method for cards stored on file in your Google Account. Returned payment data includes your personal account number (PAN), expiration month, and expiration year. You are redirected to a test 3D Secure page to authenticate the payment.
    - **Cryptogram 3DS**: Authentication method for cards stored as Android device tokens. Returned payment data includes a 3D Secure cryptogram generated on the device. You are not redirected to authenticate the payment.  
    For more information about testing, see Google Pay â€“ <a href="https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/resources/sample-tokens" target="_blank">Test with sample tokens</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
 
3. Check the status of the payment in your <a href="https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/" target="_blank">test dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
