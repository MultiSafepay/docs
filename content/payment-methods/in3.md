# User guide

### Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and in, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. This is because in3 collects and require precise order specifications. Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.

### Shipment

When you ship the order, you can change the order status to **shipped** for your records, bu this is not required to trigger invoicing.

<details id="how-to-change-order-status-to-shipped">
<summary>How to change the order status to shipped</summary>
<br>

You can change the [order status](/payment-statuses/) from **completed** to **shipped**:

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
3. Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
4. Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
5. Change the status to **shipped**.
6. Send the customer the track and trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status in your backend, the following [ready-made integrations](/integrations/ready-made/) pass the updated status to your dashboard automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/updateorder) API request.

**Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.

</details>

### Surcharges

Due to changes to the Wet op het consumentenkrediet, merchants who apply [surcharges](/surcharges/) to pay later methods are now deemed credit providers under article 7:57 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek. This requires a permit from the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM).  

We therefore strongly recommend **not** applying surcharges.
