AfterPay is an online post-payment method that lets customers pay for online purchases after receiving them, and only for the items from the order they keep. When the order arrives, MultiSafepay emails the customer an invoice with a standard payment period of 14 days. The customer pays the outstanding amount by iDeal or bank transfer.

MultiSafepay offers AfterPay in Belgium and the Netherlands, where it is the largest post-payment method.
