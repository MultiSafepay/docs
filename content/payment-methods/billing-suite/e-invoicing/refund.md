# How to refund E-Invoicing transaction
There are 3 ways to refund a E-Invoicing order in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).

In all three cases of a refund, only an amount will be refunded if a payment is linked to the transaction.
If no payment is linked to the transaction, only a credit on the invoice will take place.

### Full refund order
The order can be fully reimbursed by the refund option. Please follow these steps:

1. Go to _transactions_ in the [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction overview_
3. With the search function you can find the transaction
4. Click on the transaction to open it
5. Select _refund order_
6. _Full refund_
7. _Save_.

The order is _cancelled_.

## Partial refund
The Transaction can be partially refunded in the checkout editor. Please follow these steps:

1. Go to _transactions_ in the [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction overview_
3. With the search function you can find the transaction
4. Click on the transaction to open it
5. Select _refund order_
6. Choose _Edit_
7. Choose the page(s) you want to deduct from the order
8. _Save_.

The transaction shows the credited page with the deducted amount added to the transaction.
A new payment link is generated and sent to the customer with the adjusted invoice.

### Add a discount 
Instead of deleting an page in the checkout editor you may want to add a discount. Please follow these steps:

1. Go to _transactions_ in the [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction overview_
3. With the search function you can find the transaction
4. Click on the transaction to open it
5. Select _refund order_
6. Choose _edit_
7. Add the discount as a new page in the checkout editor
For example _-1 -> discount -> amount  -> VAT_
8. Add the new order line to the order to deduct the amount given as a discount
9. _Save_.

The discount is added to the transaction.
A new payment link is generated and sent to the customer with the adjusted invoice.

In most plugins you can also refund. See the [Plugin FAQ](/integrations/) for more information.
