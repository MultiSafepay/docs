* In addition to Betaalplan's eligibility criteria, it is also required that the merchant is able to connect to MultiSafepay through the available connection methods (API and plugins - see [overview](https://docs.multisafepay.com/))

### Enable Betaalplan as payment method

Enabling Betaalplaan as a payment method depends on your current connection. We advise you to first [contact](<mailto:sales@multisafepay.com>) your MultiSafepay account manager to check whether a connection with MultiSafepay and Santander is possible.

### An account with MultiSafepay, but not with Santander

If you already have a MultiSafepay account and would like to apply for this payment method, please [contact](<mailto:sales@multisafepay.com>) your account manager. After the eligibility check, your account manager will begin the application with Santander on your behalf.

### No account with MultiSafepay and Santander

We advise you to first open an account with MultiSafepay if you do not yet have an account with either of us. MultiSafepay will submit the application for Betaalplan at Santander during the screening process of your account at MultiSafepay.

### An account with Santander, but not with MultiSafepay

Apply for MultiSafepay Control online or [contact](<mailto:sales@multisafepay.com>) one of our account managers for further information.
In case Santander already has an active working relation with a merchant for any of their other products, such merchant is considered to be a client of Santander.
