# What it is
Betaalplan online is a pay after delivery service offered in collaboration with Santander, that allows the customer to pay off a purchase after receiving the order, as a one-off post-payment or in monthly installments. Betaalplan emails the customer an invoice with instructions on how to fulfill the monthly payments.
