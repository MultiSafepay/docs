# Request refund
A Betaalplan transaction can be either fully or partially refunded in [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) 

In both cases, the amount will be refunded only if there is an initial payment linked to the transaction. Otherwise, only a credit on the invoice will take place.

## Full or partial transaction refund
Please follow these steps to refund a Betaalplan transaction:

1. Login into your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction -> transaction overview
3. Find the transaction through search
4. Open transaction
5. Select _refund_
6. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer
7. Confirm the refund.

* The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day

* The amount is deducted from the transaction. The refund will always be linked to the original transaction

* In most plugins you can also refund. See the [Plugin FAQ](/integrations/plugins/) for more information

* Once the refund is confirmed, there is no possibility to reverse the refund

* The initialized refund will be handed over to Santander who will handle the refund request. It is possible to initialize a refund at any time as there is no time limit on processing a refund.

> A refund will only be processed if the balance on your MultiSafepay Control is sufficient.


## Change order before shipment
If you want to change a Betaalplan order between acceptance of Santander and shipment by the Merchant, follow these steps:

1. Login into your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _Transaction_ -> _Transaction overview_
3. Locate the transaction and click on _Change order status_ under Order summary
4. Change the status of the initial order to _'Shipped'_ and add a Memo
5. Refund the required amount: the original or partial amount.
It is not possible to increase the amount of the initial order. If for some reason this is required, please contact your account manager.
