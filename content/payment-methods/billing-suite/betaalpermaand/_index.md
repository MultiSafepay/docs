### Product rules

- You cannot [adjust payment link lifetimes](/faq/api/lifetime-of-a-payment-link).

- See also User guide – [Known errors](/payment-methods/billing-suite/betaalpermaand/faq/known-errors/).

{{< details title="Gift cards" >}}
&nbsp;  
Post-payment methods do not generally support entering [gift card](/payment-methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards) details **after** the order is placed (for a whole or partial payment). This is because, as the collecting party, Klarna requires very precise order specifications. 

Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount (not included in the shopping cart specification) and wouldn't generate the correct order information, e.g. for tax purposes. 

Customers can enter gift card details **before** placing the order, i.e. on your checkout page, before the API request. You are solely responsible for enabling this feature. Failure to follow this rule so can produce unexpected errors and complications.
