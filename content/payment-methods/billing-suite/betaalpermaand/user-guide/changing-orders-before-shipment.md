To change a Betaal per Maand order between approval from Santander and shipment, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transaction overview**.
3. Search for the transaction and click to open the **Transaction details** page.
4. Under **Order summary**, click **Change order status**.
5. Change the status of the initial order to **Shipped**, and then add a **Memo**.
6. Refund the required amount fully or partially. See [Processing refunds](/payment-methods/billing-suite/betaalpermaand/#processing-refunds).

You cannot increase the amount of the initial order by default. Email requests to your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>
