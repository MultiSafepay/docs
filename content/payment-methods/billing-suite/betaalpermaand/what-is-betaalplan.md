### What it is
Betaal per Maand online is a pay after delivery service offered in collaboration with Santander, that allows the customer to pay off a purchase after receiving the order, as a one-off post-payment or in monthly installments. Betaal per Maand emails the customer an invoice with instructions on how to fulfill the monthly payments.
