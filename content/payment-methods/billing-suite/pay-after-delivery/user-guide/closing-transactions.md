If you have not yet shipped an order, you can cancel the transaction by performing a full refund. See [Processing refunds](/payment-methods/billing-suite/pay-after-delivery/faq/processing-refunds/).

If you have shipped an order and the customer fails to pay, you can no longer cancel the order. To close the transaction instead, follow the **Complete own funds** steps below.

If a customer pays an invoice to you directly, you need to link the payment to the transaction in your MultiSafepay Control to change the transaction status to **Completed**. Follow the **Complete own funds** steps below.
You must also notify MultiSafepay that you received payment directly, or we may contact the customer about the oustanding amount.

Follow the **Complete own funds** steps:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transaction overview**.
3. Search for the transaction and click to open the **Transaction details** page.
4. Click **Complete own funds**. 
5. Enter a description about what happened with the order. 
6. Click **Complete**. 
    
    The total amount of the transaction is deducted from your MultiSafepay balance.  
    The invoice is considered settled.
