## What it is
Pay After Delivery is a MultiSafepay-branded deferred payment method (post-payment). Payment After Delivery's order flow and financial flow are not tied directly in a sequential order, allowing thus the customers to receive the products prior to paying for them. The working mechanism behind this payment method is a risk-based model that accounts for the order itself and for the customer's history. MultiSafepay bears the full risk of Pay After Delivery.

Pay After Delivery is a very customer friendly payment method that helps increase customer confidence and conversion for the merchant.
