## In your MultiSafepay Control

You can request in3 to process a full or partial refund, either before payout or up to 1&nbsp;year afterwards.

Refunds can only be processed for payments linked to transactions. If no payment is linked to the transaction, the customer receives credit on their invoice instead.

2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transaction overview**.
3. Search for the transaction and click to open the **Transaction details** page.
4. Click **Refund order** > **Full refund**.
5. Click **Save**.

   The transaction is cancelled.
