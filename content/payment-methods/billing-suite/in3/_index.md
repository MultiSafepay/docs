## Integration and testing

To integrate in3 using our API, see API Reference â€“ [in3](/api/#in3).

{{< details title="View credentials and testing process" >}}

Test credentials: [API key](.com/tools/multisafepay-control/get-your-api-key/)

To test in3 transactions, follow these steps:

1. Send a [Direct or redirect](/faq/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect/) API request.
2. The payment is processed in the test environment as **Successful**, with order status **Completed**, and transaction status **Uncleared**.
3. To change the order status to **Shipped**, either:
    - Send an [Update an order](/api/#update-an-order) API request, or 
    - Change the status in your MultiSafepay Test Control.
{{< br >}}The transaction status remains **Uncleared**.
4. No invoice is generated in the test control so you can't change the transaction (financial) status to **Completed**. Alternatively, in your live MultiSafepay Control, you can initiate the invoice process by changing the order status to **Shipped**, because the order is captured in in3.

You can also test in3 transactions by entering the following details on the in3 checkout page:
| Date of birth    | Postal code | House number |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 01-01-1999 | 1234AB | 1 |
| 01-01-2000 | 1111AB | 1 |

Sample statuses:

- **Approved**
- **Declined**
