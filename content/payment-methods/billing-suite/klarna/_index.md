### Product rules

{{< details title="Gift cards" >}}
&nbsp;  
Post-payment methods do not generally support entering [gift card](/payment-methods/prepaid-cards/gift-cards) details **after** the order is placed (for a whole or partial payment). This is because, as the collecting party, Klarna requires very precise order specifications. 

Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount (not included in the shopping cart specification) and wouldn't generate the correct order information, e.g. for tax purposes. 

Customers can enter gift card details **before** placing the order, i.e. on your checkout page, before the API request. You are solely responsible for enabling this feature. Failure to follow this rule so can produce unexpected errors and complications.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Multiple order rules" >}}
&nbsp;  
If you supply multiple order rules with the same `merchant-item-id`and the customer requests a partial refund, this creates a conflict. 

To successfully process partial refunds for the same product with different specifications (e.g. size, color) via the shopping cart, each `merchant-item-id` must be unique.

**Example:** For different-sized products, differentiate the `merchant-item-id` with `-size`: 1001311-xxl, 1001311-m, 1001311-s.

## Payment flow

The table below shows the Klarna payment flow from start to finish.  

In your MultiSafepay Control > **Transaction overview** > **Transaction details** page, there are two statuses that change as the flow progresses: 

- Order status: indicates the status of the customer's order with the merchant independent of the payment
- Transaction status: indicates the status of the payment

|                       | Flow      | Order status | Transaction status |
|--------------------------------|-----------|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1. | The customer initiates a transaction on the Klarna payment page. {{< br >}} See also [Reservation and invoice numbers](/payment-methods/billing-suite/klarna/faq/reservation-and-invoice-number/). | Uncleared   | Initialized  |
| | The transaction is successful, but Klarna hasn't received payment yet. | Completed  | Uncleared  |
| 2. | Ship the order within 28 days, or [extend the shipping period](/payment-methods/billing-suite/klarna/faq/extending-shipping-period/). {{< br >}} See also [Supported addresses](/payment-methods/billing-suite/klarna/faq/supported-addresses/). | | |
| 3. | [Change the order status to Shipped](/payment-methods/billing-suite/klarna/faq/changing-order-status-completed-to-shipped/).  | | | 
| 4. | MultiSafepay sends a capture to Klarna. | Shipped    | Uncleared  |
| 5. | Klarna confirms the transaction. | | |
| 6. | MultiSafepay sends the customer an invoice. Your payout is now guaranteed. {{< br >}} See also [Customizing invoices](/payment-methods/billing-suite/klarna/faq/customizing-invoices/). | | |
| 7. | Klarna pays the funds to MultiSafepay (after 14 business days). | Shipped    | Completed  |
| 8. | MultiSafepay deducts the transaction fee and adds the remaining funds to your MultiSafepay balance (after 18-19 days). {{< br >}} **Note:** In your MultiSafepay Control > **Transaction details** page, the merchant fee always displays as 0,00.| | |
| 9. | If the customer returns some items from the order, you can [place the collection period on hold](/payment-methods/billing-suite/klarna/faq/placing-collection-period-on-hold/) for 2 to 4 weeks.  | | |

### Other statuses

| Description                      | Order status      | Transaction status |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Klarna has rejected the transaction. See Klarna&nbsp;–&nbsp;[Contact customer service](https://www.klarna.com/international/contact-customer-service). {{< br >}} **Or** {{< br >}} The customer or merchant cancelled the transaction.    | Void   | Cancelled   |
| The transaction was not completed or the [order status did not change to Shipped]((/payment-methods/billing-suite/klarna/faq/changing-order-status-completed-to-shipped/)), and the transaction expired. {{< br >}} Expired transactions cannot be reactivated but still appear in your MultiSafepay Control **Transaction overview**. Create a new order, if required.  | Expired    | Expired    |

### Refund statuses

## Integration
Klarna makes your ecommerce platform available in the MultiSafepay partner portal, where your credentials are generated. Use your credentials to configure the Klarna gateway in your MultiSafepay Control. 

To integrate Klarna using our API, see API Reference - [Klarna](/api/#klarna).

### Testing

{{< details title="View credentials and testing process" >}}

Test credentials:

- [API key](/tools/multisafepay-control/get-your-api-key/)
- [Klarna's test credentials](https://developers.klarna.com/en/gb/kco-v3/test-credentials)

To test Klarna transactions, follow these steps:

1. Send a [Direct or redirect](/faq/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect/) API request.
2. The payment is processed in the test environment as **Successful**, with order status **Completed**, and transaction status **Uncleared**.
3. To change the order status to **Shipped**, either:
    - Send an [Update an order](/api/#update-an-order) API request, or 
    - Change the status in your MultiSafepay Test Control.
{{< br >}}The transaction status remains **Uncleared**.
4. No invoice is generated in the test control so you can't change the transaction (financial) status to **Completed**. Alternatively, in your live MultiSafepay Control, you can initiate the invoice process by changing the order status to **Shipped**, because the order is captured in Klarna.
