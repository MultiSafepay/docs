# Request a refund 

There are 3 ways to refund a Klarna transaction in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) account.

In all three cases of a refund, an amount will be refunded only if a payment is linked to the transaction. If no payment is linked to the transaction, only a credit on the invoice will take place.

## Full refund
The transaction can be fully refunded through the refund option:

1. Go to _transactions_ in [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction overview_
3. With the search function you can find the transaction
4. Click on the transaction to open it
5. Select _refund order_
6. _Full refund_
7. _Save_.

The transaction is cancelled.

## Partial refund
The Transaction can be partially refunded in the checkout editor. Please follow these steps:

1. Go to _transactions_ in [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction overview_
3. With the search function you can find the transaction
4. Click on the transaction to open it
5. Select _refund order_
6. Choose _Edit_
7. Choose the item(s) you want to deduct from the order
8. _Save_.

The transaction shows the credited item(s) with the deducted amount added to the transaction.
A new payment link is generated and sent to the customer with the adjusted invoice.

## Add a discount
Instead of deleting an item in the checkout editor you may want to add a discount. Please follow these steps:

###### Submitting a discount with the payment method Klarna is processed on a __negative amount__ instead of on a __negative quantity__. This method of adding a discount only applies to a successfully placed Klarna transaction. More information about how to add a discount before the transaction request is submitted to MultiSafepay is available on our [API Documentation page](/api/#discount)


1. Go to _transactions_ in the [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction overview_
3. With the search function you can find the transaction
4. Click on the transaction to open it
5. Select _refund order_
6. Choose _edit_
7. Add the discount as a new page in the checkout editor.\
_**For example, quantity (1) -> discount (item or name) -> amount (as negative)-> VAT**_
8. Add the new order line to the order to deduct the amount given as a discount
9. _Save_.

The discount is added to the transaction. A new payment link is generated and sent to the customer with the adjusted invoice.

In most plugins you can also refund. See the corresponding [plugin FAQ](/integrations/plugins/) for more information.



_Pay-after-delivery methods allow customers to pay only for items they keep from an order. This means that sometimes the complete customer journey also consists of a product return process. In the event of the return process taking too long to verify, the collection period can be paused for 2 to 4 weeks by placing it on hold. This can only be done via <webwinkel@klarna.nl> or +31 208082853_
