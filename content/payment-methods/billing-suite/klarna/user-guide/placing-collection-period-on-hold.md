Buy now pay later services let customers pay only for items they keep from an order. This means sometimes customers return products. 

If the return process takes too long to verify, you can place the collection period on hold for 2 to 4 weeks. Call Klarna on +31 208082853 or email Klarna Sales at <verkoop@klarna.com>
