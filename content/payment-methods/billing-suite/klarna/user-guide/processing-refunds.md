{{< details title="Refund rules" >}}
- You cannot refund more than the amount of the original transaction.

- There is no time limit on refunding successful transactions, so long as the receiving bank can process the refund.

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- Refunds can only be processed for payments linked to transactions. If no payment is linked to the transaction, the customer receives credit on their invoice instead.

- The customer receives the refund in the bank account they originally paid from within the next business day.

If a refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>

{{< details title="Discounts" >}}

Discounts are processed as a **negative amount** instead of a **negative quantity**. This method of adding discounts only applies to successful transactions. 

For how to add discounts **before** the transaction request is submitted to MultiSafepay, see API Reference - [Discount](/api/#discount).

Instead of deleting an item in the checkout editor, you may want to add a discount. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transaction overview**.
3. Search for the transaction and click to open the **Transaction details** page.
4. Click **Refund order** > **Edit**.
5. Add the discount as a new page in the checkout editor.  
    Example: quantity (1) > discount (item or name) > amount (as negative) > VAT
6. To deduct the amount of the discount, add a new line to the order.
7. Click **Save**.

   The discount is added to the transaction. 
   A new payment link is generated and sent to the customer with the adjusted invoice.
