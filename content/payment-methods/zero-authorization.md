Zero Authorization is a MultiSafepay solution that lets you verify a credit card without charging the cardholder. Simply charge an amount of 0 EUR to the credit card (with or without [3D Secure](/docs/3ds2/) authentication). 

MultiSafepay stores the sensitive payment details as a non-sensitive token, and then checks if the card is legitimate. 

You can then also use tokens for [recurring payments](/docs/recurring-payments/).

# Activation

Email a request to activate Zero Authorization to <sales@multisafepay.com>

# Integration

Zero Authorization supports Maestro, Mastercard, and Visa, and is available in all countries and currencies.
