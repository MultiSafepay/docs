Zero Authorization is a MultiSafepay solution that lets you verify a card without charging the cardholder. Simply charge an amount of 0 EUR to the card (with or without [3D Secure](/docs/3ds2/) authentication).

MultiSafepay stores the sensitive payment details as a non-sensitive token, and then checks if the card is legitimate.

You can then also use tokens for [recurring payments](/docs/recurring-payments/).

# Activation

Email a request to activate Zero Authorization to [sales@multisafepay.com](mailto:sales@multisafepay.com)

# Integration
