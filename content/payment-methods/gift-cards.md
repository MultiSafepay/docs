Gift cards are pre-loaded with a specific amount of credit that customers can use to make online or POS payments. Customers can use gift cards to pay for a transaction in full or in part, and make up the rest with another payment method. Gift card payments are processed by the card issuer.

## Known error

VVV Cadeaukaart cards can sometimes throw an error where the credit balance appears to be 0, but is then restored within 24 hours (potentially affected by weekends and holidays). This appears to be due to temporary failures in the card issuer's system. 

If a customer completes a payment and receives this error message, advise them to wait for 1 hour for a confirmation email before trying again to avoid placing two orders.

## Pay later methods

When paying with a gift card and a [pay later method](/payment-methods/pay-later/), customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. 

This is because pay later methods collect and require precise order specifications. Our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.
