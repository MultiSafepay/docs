## Customer credibility score

You can request MultiSafepay to perform a credibility assessment of the customer to help reduce fraud. 
Email <sales@multisafepay.com>

## Customer pays you directly

If the customer pays you directly instead of MultiSafepay, to complete the order, simply pay MultiSafepay the order amount from your account balance. This stops MultiSafepay sending the customer an invoice. 

If you do so:
- **After** MultiSafepay has paid you out, then we refund you the order amount
- **Before** MultiSafepay pays you out, then we cancel the payout

After paying for an order from your account balance, you can no longer refund the customer.

## Expiration and extensions

You define the expiration period for the order, up to a maximum of 180 days (including extensions). If the order is not at least [partially shipped](#partially-ship-order) within this period, it is cancelled and [refunded](#refunds).

## Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and E-Invoicing, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. Otherwise our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.

MultiSafepay can customize the formatting of your invoices on request. Email <sales@multisafepay.com>

</details>

## Shipment

- You must ship to receive paymen **before** the order expires.
- Share the track & trace details with the customer and MultiSafepay, if relevant. 
- You can ship orders in full or in multiple parts. See [Partially ship order](#partially-ship-order) below.
- You must update the <<glossary:order status>> to **Shipped**. See [Update the order status](#update-the-order-status) below. 

### Partially ship order

<details id="how-to-partially-ship-an-order">
<summary>How to partially ship an order</summary>
<br>

If you cannot ship all the items for an order at the same time, you can ship the order in multiple parts.

See API reference ‚Äì [Update or cancel order](/reference/updateorder) > **Ship order**.

**Partial capture**

If you have partially shipped an order and the order expires, MultiSafepay collects the funds for all shipped items and cancels the unshipped items. 

API integration: In your [Ship order](/reference/updateorder) request, set the `amount` for the first partial shipment lower than the total order `amount` (or the total of the `shopping_cart`) in the original [create order](/reference/createorder) request. 

**Multi-shipment**

MultiSafepay collects for each partial shipment when it is shipped, until all items are shipped, or you or the customer cancels the outstanding items. 

Multi-shipment is disabled by default. To enable, email <sales@multisafepay.com>

**Integration**

A unique shipment `order_id` is generated for each partial shipment.

See API reference ‚Äì [Update or cancel order](/reference/updateorder) > **Ship order**.

**Notifications**

You receive a webhook notification when the <<glossary:order status>> of each partial shipment changes to **Shipped**.

The status of the main transaction never changes to **Completed**. It remains **Initialized**, with a flag.

**Refunds**

You must must refund partial shipments separately, using the specific **shipment** `order_id`, instead of the original **invoice** `order_id`.

See API reference ‚Äì [Refund order](/reference/refundorder).

---

</details>

### Update the order status

<details id="how-to-update-the-order-status">
<summary>How to update the order status</summary>
<br>

When you ship the order, you **must** update the <<glossary:order status>> via the dashboard or your integration from **Completed** to **Shipped** to receive your payout, and to prevent the order from expiring.

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**, and then click the relevant transaction.
3. On the **Transaction details** page, under **Order details**, click **Change order status**.
4. From the **Change status to** list, select **Shipped**.
5. In the **Memo** field, enter a comment.
6. Click **OK**.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status in your <<glossary:backend>>, the following [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/) pass the updated status to your dashboard automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **Delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](/reference/updateorder/) API request.

‚ùóÔ∏è **Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.

---

</details>

## Shopping carts

You can choose whether or not to include a `shopping_cart` object in your [create order](/reference/createorder) request (we normally recommend this for BNPL orders).

See Recipes ‚Äì [Display shopping cart](/recipes/display-shopping-cart).

You can also then refund with or without the `shopping_cart`, but for simplicity we recommend matching the refund request to the original order request.

## Terms and conditions

- For <<glossary:direct>> flows, you must display your terms and conditions in your checkout.
- For <<glossary:redirect>> flows, MultiSafepay terms and conditions are displayed by default on [payment pages](/docs/payment-pages/).
