# User guide

You can generate E-Invoicing transactions in batches for subscription payments.

<details id="how-to-batch-transactions-for-subscriptions">
<summary>How to batch transactions for subscriptions</summary>
<br>

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.

## Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and E-Invoicing, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. Otherwise our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.

**In your backend**

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **Shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](/reference/updateorder/) API request.

**Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.
