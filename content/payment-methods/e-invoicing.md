## Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and E-Invoicing, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. Otherwise our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.
