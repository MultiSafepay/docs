# User guide

## Batching transactions for subscriptions

<details id="how-to-batch-transactions-for-subscriptions">
<summary>How to batch transactions for subscriptions</summary>
<br>

To generate E-Invoicing transactions in batches for subscription payments:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **E-Invoicing** > **Batches**. 
3. Upload a file in .xls, .xlsx or .csv format.

</details>

## Gift cards

When paying with a gift card and E-Invoicing, customers must enter the gift card details **before** placing their order, i.e. on your checkout page. Otherwise our platform would interpret the gift card as a discount and generate incorrect order information, e.g. tax calculations.

You are solely responsible for this in your integration.

## Shipment

When you ship the order, you **must** manually change the order status to **shipped**:

- Captures the funds
- Triggers sending the invoice to the customer
- Prevents the order from expiring

<details id="how-to-change-order-status-to-shipped">

<br>

You can change the [order status](/payment-statuses/) from **completed** to **shipped**:

**In your dashboard**

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
3. Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
4. Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
5. Change the status to **shipped**.
6. Send the customer the track and trace details, if relevant.

**In your backend**

If you change the order status in your backend, the following [ready-made integrations](/integrations/ready-made/) pass the updated status to your dashboard automatically:

- Magento 2 and WooCommerce: When you set the order to **shipped** in your backend.
- Shopware 5: When you set the order to **delivered** in your backend.

For other ready-made integrations, make an [update order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/updateorder) API request.

**Note:** Some third-party plugins may not support updating the status via our API.
