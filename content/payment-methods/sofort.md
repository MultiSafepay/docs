<a href="https://www.klarna.com/pay-now/" target="_blank">Sofort</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> is a banking payment method by Klarna. It integrates directly with the customer's bank like a direct bank transfer. The customer verifies the payment, which reduces the risks associated with traditional transfers. 
Once payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it and Sofort guarantees <<glossary:settlement>>.
