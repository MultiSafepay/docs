<a href="https://www.klarna.com/pay-now/" target="_blank">Sofort</a> <i className="fa fa-external-link" style={{ fontSize: "12px", color: "#8b929e" }} /> is a banking payment method by Klarna. It integrates with the customer's bank like a <Glossary>direct</Glossary> bank transfer. The customer verifies the payment, which reduces the risks associated with traditional transfers.\
<br />
Once payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it, and Sofort guarantees <Glossary>settlement</Glossary>.

### Amount limits and processing times

Amounts **less than** 100 EUR are transferred immediately.\
Amounts **over** 100 EUR require approval from Sofort and can take a few days to change to **Completed**.

To speed up Sofort payments, you can increase your limit above 100 EUR. First, consider how much risk is acceptable to your business in case Sofort declines a payment.

To adjust your Sofort limit, email [sales@multisafepay.com](mailto:sales@multisafepay.com).
