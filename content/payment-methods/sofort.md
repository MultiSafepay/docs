<a href="https://www.klarna.com/pay-now/" target="_blank">Sofort</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> is a banking payment method by Klarna. It integrates with the customer's bank like a <<glossary:direct>> bank transfer. The customer verifies the payment, which reduces the risks associated with traditional transfers. 
Once payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it and Sofort guarantees <<glossary:settlement>>.

### Amount limits and processing times

Amounts **less than** 100 EUR are transferred immediately. 
Amounts **over** 100 EUR require approval from Sofort and can take a few days to change to **Completed**. 

To speed up Sofort payments, you can increase your limit above 100 EUR. First consider how much risk is acceptable to your business in case Sofort declines a payment. 

To adjust your Sofort limit, email <sales@multisafepay.com>
