[Sofort](https://www.klarna.com/pay-now/) is a banking payment method by Klarna. It integrates directly with the customer's bank like a direct bank transfer. The customer verifies the payment, which reduces the risks associated with traditional transfers. 
Once payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it and Sofort guarantees settlement.
