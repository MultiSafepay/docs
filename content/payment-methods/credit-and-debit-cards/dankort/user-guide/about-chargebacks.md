Cardholders who disagree with or do not recognise a transaction charged to their credit card can ask Dankort to raise a dispute. Dankort then notifies MultiSafepay and reclaims the transaction amount from the merchant.

Dankort gives cardholders the right to claim chargebacks for up to 180 days after the purchase.

For more information, see [Chargebacks](/faq/chargebacks).
