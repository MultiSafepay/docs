Under the [PCI DSS](/faq/general/glossary#Payment-Card-Industry-Data-Security-Standard), payment service providers and businesses that handle credit card data must follow extensive security protocols and data management practices to protect customers and merchants. MultiSafepay is PCI compliant and you can accept credit card payments through MultiSafepay payment pages even if you are not PCI compliant.
