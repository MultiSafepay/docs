## How it works
In order to pay with Mastercard, Visa or American Express the customer needs to fill in their card number, CVC-code and expiry date to release a payment. When the 3D Secure is enabled on the credit card, the customer needs to provide an authentic code on the next page to finalize the payment. The 3D secure insures that the customer is the rightful account holder.

As payment processor, MultiSafepay is an [acquirer](/faq/getting-started/glossary/#acquirer) itself for Visa and Mastercard.

### "Visa, Mastercard and American Express" transaction flow
The transaction flow shows the different ways a transaction can be processed. This differs per payment method.

* Order status      
The order status indicates the status of the order, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. The order status is independent of the incoming or outgoing payment of the transaction.

* Transaction status       
The transaction status indicates the payment status of the transaction, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. Once the transaction status is _completed_, the amount of the transaction is added to your MultiSafepay balance.

Credit card transactions received by MultiSafepay will be processed through our fraud filter. The following statuses are important when receiving a credit card payment:

| Order Status                      | Transaction Status      | Description |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialized | Initialized | A payment link has been generated, but no payment has been received yet.  | 
| Completed   | Completed   | A successful credit card  transaction has been received and the funds will be added to your MultiSafepay Control balance.   | 
| Uncleared   | Uncleared   |  Waiting for manual permission of the merchant to approve/disapprove the payment. [Read more on accepting uncleared credit card payments, how and why?](/faq/risk-and-fraud/how-to-accept-an-uncleared-transaction/)  | 
| Declined    | Declined    | Transaction has been rejected. [read more on credit card status 'declined'. What does this mean?](/payment-methods/creditcards/creditcard-status-declined-what-does-this-mean-/) | 
| Expired     | Expired     | An unfinished transaction will automatically expire after a predefined period.  | 
| Void        | Cancelled    | Transaction has been cancelled.   | 


#### Transaction flow when processing on own MID 
> When using an own MID (MerchantID) from American Express, the funds are not processed by MultiSafepay. Instead, the funds will be added to your own balance at American Express.


| Order Status                      | Transaction Status      | Description |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialized | Initialized | A payment link has been generated, but no payment has been received yet.  | 
| Uncleared   | Initialized | Waiting for manual permission of the merchant to approve/disapprove the payment. [Read more on accepting uncleared credit card payments, how and why?](/faq/risk-and-fraud/how-to-accept-an-uncleared-transaction/)  | 
| Completed   | Initialized | A successful credit card  transaction has been received and the funds will be added to your MultiSafepay Control balance.   | 


#### Refund flow
