Cardholders who disagree with or do not recognise a transaction charged to their credit card can ask V Pay to raise a dispute. V Pay then notifies MultiSafepay and reclaims the transaction amount from the merchant.

V Pay gives cardholders the right to claim chargebacks for up to 180 days after the purchase.

For more information about chargebacks, see [Chargebacks](/faq/chargebacks).
