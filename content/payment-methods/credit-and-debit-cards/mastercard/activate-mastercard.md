## Activate

With MultiSafepay, Mastercard is an additional (non-standard) payment method. You can submit the application to activate the payment method through one of our account managers at <sales@multisafepay.com>

To activate Mastercard as a payment method for your webshop, we would like to receive the following information from you:

* Average transaction amount
* Minimum transaction amount
* Maximum transaction amount
* Yearly credit card turnover

The abovementioned information will be sent to our Risk team who will assess whether you are eligibe for this payment method.
