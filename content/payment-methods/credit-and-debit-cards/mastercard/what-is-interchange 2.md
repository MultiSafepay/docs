## Interchange++
Payment service providers can choose the Interchange++ (Interchange plus-plus) pricing model to ensure transparency, by breaking down costs per individual exchange (e.g. between card scheme and acquiring bank). This means that there are no preset prices for the total of all transactions and that the fee is calculated based on the sum of all costs of the individual transactions that have been processed. 

When processing credit card transactions, banks and payment schemes like Visa and Mastercard charge fees to cover the operational costs of managing their network.

Costs are different for each transaction, based on factors like:

* the country where the card of the customer is issued
* the country where the transaction is processed
* the type of card (businesses or customer card)
* the way the card is accepted (security level)
* the transaction size.

The payment schemes and banks also calculate different fees (within a certain bandwidth). So overall, the real costs are hard to predict beforehand.

To get the costs per individual transaction to be transparent, payment service providers can choose Interchange ++
