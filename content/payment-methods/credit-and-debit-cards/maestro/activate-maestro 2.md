## Activate

With MultiSafepay, Maestro is additional (non-standard) payment method. You can submit the application to activate the payment method through one of our account managers at <sales@multisafepay.com>

To activate Maestro as payment method for your webshop, we would like to receive the following information from you:

The abovementioned information will be sent to our Risk team who will assess whether you are eligibe for this payment method.
