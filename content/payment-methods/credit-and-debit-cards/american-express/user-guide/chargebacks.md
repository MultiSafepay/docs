Cardholders who disagree with or do not recognise a transaction charged to their credit card can ask American Express to raise a dispute. American Express then notifies MultiSafepay and reclaims the transaction amount from the merchant.

American Express gives cardholders the right to claim chargebacks for up to 180 days after the purchase.

For more information about chargebacks, see [Chargebacks](/faq/chargebacks).
