## Declined
If a Visa payment of a customer receives the status _declined_, it may be for several reasons. Only the customer can contact their credit card issuer to inquire as to why the credit card payment has been _declined_.

For questions about credit card payments and/or a payment status (of a credit card transaction), please contact us at <support@multisafepay.com>

In most cases the declined reason is shown behind the declined status within the transaction in your MultiSafepay Control. 

| Transaction status | Reason | Description |
------- |----------|---------|
Declined | transaction not allowed | The fraud filter of MultiSafepay is declining the transaction. Contact our support department at <support@multisafepay.com> for further information.
Declined | Do not honour | This information is not shared with MultiSafepay, only the card holder can retrieve the information at the issuing bank.
Declined | 3D authorisation cancelled | When the 3D secure verification is incomplete or can not be validated, the payment will be declined.

Declined | Not sufficient funds | The customer has insufficient credit on the credit card to complete the payment.
