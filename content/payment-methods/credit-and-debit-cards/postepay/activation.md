Postepay payments are processed through the Visa or Mastercard gateway.

To make Postepay available as a payment method on the MultiSafepay credit card payment page, you need to:

- Ensure you have enabled the Visa or Mastercard gateway.
- Set the [`locale`](/faq/api/locale) to `it_IT` (France) in transaction requests.

Download the Postepay logo from the [MultiSafepay logo collection](/faq/general/where-find-logo-payment-methods) and upload it to your ecommerce platform.
