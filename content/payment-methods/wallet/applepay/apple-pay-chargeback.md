## Chargebacks

Since Apple Pay payments are credit card transactions, merchants are [3D secure](/faq/general/glossary/#3d-secure) protected for customer fraud. In such situations whereby a customer initiates a chargeback, please send an email to <retrieval@multisafepay.com> and MultiSafepay will challenge the chargeback on your behalf.

Please make sure to read more information about [chargebacks](/faq/chargebacks) on our documentation page.
