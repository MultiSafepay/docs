## Chargebacks

Apple Pay payments are credit card transactions, therefore you are protected against fraud by [3D Secure](/faq/general/glossary/#3d-secure). 

If a customer initiates a chargeback, we will challenge the chargeback on your behalf. Email the Finance Team at <retrieval@multisafepay.com> 

For more information, see FAQ â€“ [Chargebacks](/faq/chargebacks).
