## Chargebacks

Since Apple Pay payments are credit card transactions, merchants are 3D secure protected for consumer fraud. In such situations whereby a consumer initiates a chargeback, please send an email to <retrieval@multisafepay.com> and MultiSafepay will challenge the chargeback on your behalf.

Please make sure to read more information about [chargebacks](/faq/chargebacks/) on our documentation page.
