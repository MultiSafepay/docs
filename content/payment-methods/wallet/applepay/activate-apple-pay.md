## Activate

Apple Pay is a standard payment method in the [MultiSafepay Contol](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)<br>

In order for Apple Pay to be activated, you must first enable credit cards in your MultiSafepay Control. You can submit the application to enable credit cards as a payment method through our Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com> __Please also mention alongside your application that you would like for Apple Pay to be enabled.__

To activate credit cards as payment methods for your webshop, we would like to receive the following information from you:

- Average transaction amount
- Minimum transaction amount
- Maximum transaction amount
- Yearly turnover by credit cards.

When approved by our Risk Team, Visa, Mastercard and Apple Pay will be enabled in your MultiSafepay Control as payment methods.

_If credit cards are already enabled as a payment method, you can contact <integration@multisafepay.com> and we will activate Apple Pay for you._
