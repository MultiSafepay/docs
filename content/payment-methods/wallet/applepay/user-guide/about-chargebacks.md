Apple Pay payments are credit card transactions. 

Cardholders who disagree with or do not recognise a transaction charged to their credit card can ask Apple Pay to raise a dispute. 

If a customer initiates a chargeback, MultiSafepay can challenge it on your behalf. Email the Finance Team at <retrieval@multisafepay.com> 

For more information, see [Chargebacks](/faq/chargebacks).
