## Refunds

To refund Apple Pay transactions, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Transaction overview**. 
3. Search for the transaction and open the **Transaction details** page.
4. Click **Refund**.
5. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer.
6. Click **Confirm refund**.

The transaction and order statuses change to **Initialized**. While the transaction and order statuses remain **Initialized**, you can cancel the refund. When the transaction status changes to **Completed**, the refund has been processed.

The refund is paid to the customer's Apple Pay account and appears on their credit card statement within the next business day. 

Refunds cannot be processed if your MultiSafepay balance is insufficient.
