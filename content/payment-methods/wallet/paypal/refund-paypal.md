## Request refund
The refund of a PayPal transaction can be processed from within your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).

Please follow these steps:

1. Select _Transactions -> Transaction overview_
2. Find the transaction through search
3. Open the transaction
4. Select _refund_
5. Fill in the amount that you are going to refund to the customer
6. _Confirm_.

>_Please note that by default, MultiSafepay does not allow for you to refund more than the stated amount of the original transaction. Please refer to the [product rules](/payment-methods/paypal/#product-rules) for more information._

* The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day

* PayPal transactions can be refunded within 60 days

* A refund will only be processed if your PayPal balance is sufficient. Otherwise, PayPal will proceed with issuing an [eCheck](https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/what-is-an-echeck-faq1082). You will need to make sure that PayPal is authorized to withdraw funds from a linked bank account when a refund is requested and your balance is insufficient, in order to avoid a potential cancellation on PayPal's side. As a merchant, you will need to take care of these settings yourself, from within your PayPal account. Failing to do so can result in a cancelled refund and follow-up complaints and escalation from your customers. For any questions related to this topic, we strongly encourage you to reach out to PayPal's support.
