FastCheckout is MultiSafepay's own multi-currency wallet that lets customers make online payments quickly and securely. 

Customers create a FastCheckout account (once only) and submit their payment details. When customers select FastCheckout from your checkout page, they are redirected to a FastCheckout payment page to complete payment, and then back to your website.
