Fastcheckout is MultiSafepay's own multi-currency wallet that lets customers make online payments quickly and securely. 

Customers create a Fastcheckout account (once only) and submit their payment details. When customers select Fastcheckout from your checkout page, they are redirected to a Fastcheckout payment page to complete payment, and then back to your website. 

## Packages

- Fastcheckout is included in one of our Connect packages, where you can enable all payment methods in your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
