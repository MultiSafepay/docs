## Activate
Bancontact QR is a standard payment method which is activated together with the regular Bancontact.

There are two ways to activate Bancontact as a payment method in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com):

1. Globally (enable this payment method for all websites connected to your MultiSafepay Control) - Go to _settings > payment methods_
2. Specifically (enable this payment method at site-level) - Go to _settings_ > _website settings_ > open website > activate bank transfer as payment method.

Enable Bancontact as payment method in your ecommerce platform to finalize the connection.

Read the regular [Bancontact](/payment-methods/banks/bancontact/#activate) pages to activate Bancontact and Bancontact QR.
