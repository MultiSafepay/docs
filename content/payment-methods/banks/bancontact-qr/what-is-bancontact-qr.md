## What it is
Bancontact QR is an alternative way to initiate a payment via Bancontact. The payment is initiated from a QR code, presented to the customer for instance at a mobile device. The customer scans the QR code and the bank-app at his mobile phone will handle the payment.

Bancontact QR is only supported for Belgium.
