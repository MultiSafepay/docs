## What it is
With over 80% of Belgian webshops offering it as a payment option, Bancontact is a household name and the market leader for electronic payments in Belgium. Payments are done using the mobile banking app or online. 

Bancontact is only supported for Belgium and non-mobile payments always use 3D Secure 1.0 verification.
