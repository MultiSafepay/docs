Bancontact is a leading Belgian payment method that supports online, mobile app, and POS payments. Bancontact is a household name and supported by over 80% of Belgian webshops. It was formerly known as Mister Cash.

Once a payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it and Bancontact guarantees settlement.

Non-mobile payments always use [3D Secure](/faq/general/glossary/#3d-secure) 1.0 verification.
