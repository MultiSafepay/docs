iDEAL QR is an additional service offered by the Dutch payment method [iDEAL](/payment-methods/banks/ideal).
 
Customers pay by using their smartphone to scan a QR code, on paper or on screen. This lets you bring offline payments online. 

**Note:** Most Dutch banks have their own QR code on their payment page, but this is not the same as iDEAL QR.

- You can use the same iDEAL QR code more than once.

- You can generate more than one payment link for a single order ID. Subsequent transactions each have a unique order ID.
