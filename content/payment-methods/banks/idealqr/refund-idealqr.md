## Request refund
You can refund iDEAL QR transactions either in [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) or through our [API](/api/#ref_create_refund)

Please follow these steps to refund a iDEAL QR transaction:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction > transaction overview_
3. Find the transaction through search
4. Open transaction
5. Select _refund_
6. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer  
7. Confirm the refund.

>_Please note that by default, MultiSafepay does not allow for you to refund more than the stated amount of the original transaction. Please refer to the [product rules](/payment-methods/banks/idealqr/#product-rules) for more information._

The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day

>_A refund will only be processed if your balance on your MultiSafepay Control is sufficient_.

If an iDEAL QR refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
