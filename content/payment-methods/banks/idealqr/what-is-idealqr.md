## What it is
iDEAL QR is an additional service offered by the Dutch payment method [iDEAL](/payment-methods/ideal/)
 
As the name suggests, iDeal QR allows customers to pay directly with their smartphone, from both screen and print. With iDEAL QR you can take offline payments to the online world. Most Dutch banks have their own QR codes on their payment screens, but this is not the same as iDEAL QR.
