## Request refund 
Please follow these steps to refund a Dotpay transaction:

1. Login into your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)
2. Select _transaction -> transaction overview_ 
3. Find the transaction through search
4. Open transaction
5. Select _refund_
6. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer  
7. Confirm the refund.

* Refunding more than the stated amount of the original transaction is possible with Bancontact (e.g. refunding the return costs incurred by the customer). More information is available on our [refund more than original amount](/faq/finance/refund-more-than-original-amount/) page. Please bear in mind that by default, MultiSafepay does not allow refunds larger than  the original transaction amount and that this needs to be changed in your MultiSafepay Control 

* The transaction are order statuses are now _initialized_. As long as the transaction and order statuses are marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day

In the event of a failed Dotpay refund, please contact our support team at <support@multisafepay.com> to assist you.

>_A refund will only be processed if your balance on your MultiSafepay Control is sufficient._
