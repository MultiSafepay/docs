## Activate
Belfius is a standard payment method.

There are two ways to activate Belfius as a payment method in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com):

1. Globally (enable this payment method for all websites connected to your MultiSafepay Control) - Go to _settings -> payment methods_
2. Specifically (enable this payment method at site-level) - Go to _settings_ -> _website settings_ -> open website -> activate Belfius as payment method.

Enable Belfius as payment method in your ecommerce platform to finalize the connection.

If Belfius is not visible as a payment method in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/), contact our Integrations team at <integration@multisafepay.com> to assist you.

>_Before a payment method is activated, check whether the payment method is supported by your ecommerce platform_.
