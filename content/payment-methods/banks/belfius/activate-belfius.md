## Activate
Belfius is a standard payment method.

There are two ways to activate Belfius as a payment method in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com):

1. Globally (enable this payment method for all websites connected to your MultiSafepay Control) - Go to _settings > payment methods_
2. Specifically (enable this payment method at site-level) - Go to _settings_ > _website settings_ > open website > activate Belfius as payment method.

Enable Belfius as payment method in your ecommerce platform to finalize the connection.

If Belfius is not visible as a payment method in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

>_Before a payment method is activated, check whether the payment method is supported by your ecommerce platform_.
