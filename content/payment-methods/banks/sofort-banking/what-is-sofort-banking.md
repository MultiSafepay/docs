## What it is
SOFORT Banking is a popular payment method available in a few European countries and very popular in Germany. SOFORT Banking directly integrates with the customer's bank, allowing easy payments. This payment method is similar to a (direct) bank transfer, with the main difference that the customer only needs to verify the payment, reducing this way other risks associated with traditional transfers. 

SOFORT Banking is supported in the following countries within your MultiSafepay Control:

* Austria
* Belgium
* Germany  
* Italy
* Spain
* Switzerland
* Poland.
