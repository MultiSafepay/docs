## MultiSafepay local bank accounts for bank transfers

MultiSafepay has a local bank account available for European bank transfer used by customers. As a result, the customer can process the bank transfer in a familiar and faster way through a national bank account.

MultiSafepay offers national bank accounts for bank transfers of the following countries in their local currencies:

* Austria (EUR)
* Belgium (EUR)
* Czech Republic (CZK)   
* France (EUR)  
* Germany (EUR)
* Great Britain (GBP)
* Hungary (HUF)
* Italy (EUR)
* Netherlands (EUR)
* Poland (PLN)
* Portugal (EUR)
* Spain (EUR)

The cost for an international bank transfer and currency conversion will no longer be deducted from the customer's bank account.
The customer will pay the regular national fees charged by the customer's bank.

Please keep in mind that USD (Dollar) is not supported due to the very high transaction and conversion costs for the customer.
