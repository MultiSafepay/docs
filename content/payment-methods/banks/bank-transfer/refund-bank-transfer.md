## Request refund 
Please follow the following steps to refund a bank transfer transaction:

1. Login into your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)
2. Select _Transactions -> Transaction overview_
3. Find the transaction through search
4. Open the transaction
5. Select _refund_
6. Fill in the amount that you are going to refund to the customer
7. _Confirm_.

* Refunding more than the stated amount of the original transaction is possible with bank transfers (e.g. refunding the return costs incurred by the customer). More information is available on our [refund more than original amount](/faq/finance/refund-more-than-original-amount/) page. Please bear in mind that by default, MultiSafepay does not allow refunds larger than  the original transaction amount and that this needs to be changed in your MultiSafepay Control

* The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day.

>_A refund will only be processed if your balance on your MultiSafepay Control is sufficient_.
