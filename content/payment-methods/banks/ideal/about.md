iDEAL is an inter-bank payment method that links all major Dutch retail banks. It is the leading payment method in the Netherlands, comprising around 60% of all online transactions.

Customers pay via a mobile banking app or in their own online banking environment. Once a payment is completed, the customer cannot reverse it and iDEAL guarantees settlement.

To increase transparency for customers, the name of your website appears on the iDEAL payment page and "Your-website-name by MultiSafepay" on the customer's bank statement.
