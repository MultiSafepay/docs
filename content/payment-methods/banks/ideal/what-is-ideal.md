## What is it?
Around 60% of all online transactions in the Netherlands are carried through iDEAL, the leading ecommerce payment system from the Netherlands. iDEAL is an inter-bank system linking all major Dutch consumer banks. Payments are done using the mobile banking app or the online banking environment of customers' own bank.

As a merchant, your website's name is shown during the finalization of the iDEAL payment. Consequently, transparency is increased as the customer always knows what the payment is meant for. "Your-website-name by MultiSafepay" is also displayed on the bank statement following a successful transaction. 

> iDEAL is only supported in the Netherlands.
