## Request refund
Please follow these steps to refund a Giropay transaction:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _transaction > transaction_
3. Find the transaction through search
4. Open transaction
5. Select _refund_
6. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer
7. _Confirm the refund_.

>_MultiSafepay does not allow for you to refund more than the stated amount of the original transaction._

The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day

>_A refund will only be processed if your balance on your MultiSafepay Control is sufficient_.

If a Giropay refund fails, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
