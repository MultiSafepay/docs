## Activate
ING Home'Pay is a standard payment method.

ING Home'Pay can be activated in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) under _settings > payment methods_.
Enable ING Home'Pay as payment method in your ecommerce platform to finalize the activation.

If ING Home'Pay is not visible as a payment method in your MultiSafepay Control, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com> 

_Note: Before a payment method is activated, check whether the payment method is supported by your ecommerce platform and your MultiSafepay Control_.
