## Request refund
Please follow these steps to refund a ING Home'Pay transaction:

1. Select _transaction -> transaction overview in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)_
2. Find the transaction through search
3. Open transaction
4. Select _refund_
5. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer
6. _Confirm the refund_.

>_Please note that by default, MultiSafepay does not allow for you to refund more than the stated amount of the original transaction. Please refer to the [product rules](/payment-methods/ing-home-pay/#product-rules) for more information._

The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day.

>_A refund will only be processed if your balance on your MultiSafepay Control is sufficient_.

We do not automatically receive the IBAN when a transaction is completed. However, we import our bank statements daily and all incoming payments which have not been completed yet will then be completed. Refunds can therefore be done after 1 business day.

In the event of a failed ING Home'Pay refund, please contact our support team at <support@multisafepay.com> to assist you.
