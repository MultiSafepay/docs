## Request refund
Please follow these steps to refund a Request to Pay transaction:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _Transactions > Transaction overview_
3. Find the transaction through search
4. Open the transaction
5. Select _refund_
6. Fill in the amount that you are going to refund to the customer
7. Confirm the refund.

The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day

> A refund will only be processed if your balance on your MultiSafepay Control is sufficient.

_Please note that refunds will be processed by Deutsche Bank_
