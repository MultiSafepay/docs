## What is it?

Request to Pay, previously known as Direct Bank Transfer, is an innovative ecommerce solution by Deutsche Bank, allowing merchants to collect funds from their end customers who authorise the related payments in an automated, integrated and secure way. ItÂ´s based on SEPA transfers (Single Euro Payments Area) and the PSD2 Open Banking [API](/faq/general/glossary/#api)

MultiSafepay only processes Request to Pay transactions for Germany. As expansion continues, more countries will follow. The banks offering instant SEPA bank transfers is increasing as further banks migrate to PSD2 APIs'.
