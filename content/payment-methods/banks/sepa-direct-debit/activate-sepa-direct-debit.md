## Activate
As SEPA Direct Debit poses certain risks, you will need to first apply before you can process transactions. Our Risk team will conduct a screening to determine whether you are eligible. 

Please [contact](<mailto:sales@multisafepay.com>) your account manager to submit your request to use SEPA Direct Debit.

>_Please note, SEPA Direct Debit is not suitable for normal retail (e.g. clothing) because the payment can take up to 10 days for completion. Besides, a SEPA Direct Debit payment can be cancelled by the customer within 8 weeks without reason. There is no right to appeal_.
