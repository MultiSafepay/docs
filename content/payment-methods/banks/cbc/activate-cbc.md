## Activate
CBC is a standard payment method.

CBC can be activated in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) under _Settings â†’ Payment methods_.
Enable CBC as payment method in your ecommerce platform to finalize the activation.

If CBC is not visible as a payment method in your MultiSafepay Control, you can contact the Integrations team at <integration@multisafepay.com> to assist you further.

_Note: Before you request CBC to be activated, check whether this payment method is supported by your ecommerce platform and your MultiSafepay Control_.
