## What is the difference between KBC/CBC?

Essentially, there is no real difference between these two payment methods. Both payment methods offer the same way of paying for your products. 

The main difference is that CBC is focused on the French speaking part of Belgium, whereas [KBC](/payment-methods/banks/kbc) is meant for the Dutch speaking population of Belgium. 

Itâ€™s important to note that, due to KBC and CBC being two different branches, in our payment gateway you will be provided with a separate option for both of these payment methods. Customers under KBC cannot complete transactions through CBC and vice-versa. The way they function, however, is exactly the same.
