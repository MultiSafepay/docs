The table below shows a successful payment flow from start to finish.  

{{< details title="About order and transaction statuses" >}}

In your MultiSafepay account > **Transaction overview** > **Transaction details** page under **Status history**, there are two statuses that change as the flow progresses: 

- Order status: indicates the status of the customer's order with the merchant independent of the payment
- Transaction status: indicates the status of the payment

{{< /details >}}

|   | Flow | Order status | Transaction status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | The customer initiates a transaction and is redirected to a MultiSafepay PayV2 payment page. | Initialized | Initialized |
| 2. | The customer authenticates their account and completes the payment. {{< br >}} **Note:** If the customer doesn’t click the **Return to website** button, MultiSafepay doesn’t receive an update and the transaction status remains **Initialized**. We import our bank statements daily and all incoming payments are then finalized. | | |
| 3. | The transaction is successful, and KBC settles the funds with MultiSafepay.  | Completed | Completed |
| 4. | MultiSafepay adds the funds to your MultiSafepay balance.| | |

## Unsuccessful statuses

| Description | Order status | Transaction status |
|---|---|---|
| The transaction has been cancelled. | Void   | Cancelled   |
| The customer didn't complete the payment and the transaction expired after the predetermined period. | Expired | Expired |
