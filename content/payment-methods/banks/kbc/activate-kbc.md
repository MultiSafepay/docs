## Activate
KBC is a standard payment method.

KBC can be activated in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) under _settings -> payment methods_.
Enable KBC as payment method in your ecommerce platform to finalize the activation.

If KBC is not visible as a payment method in your MultiSafepay Control, you can contact the Integrations team at <integration@multisafepay.com> to assist you further.

_Note: Before you request KBC to be activated, check whether this payment method is supported by your ecommerce platform and your MultiSafepay Control_.
