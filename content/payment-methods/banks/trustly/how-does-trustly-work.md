## How it works
When the customer selects Trustly as payment method, he/she needs to select the desired country.
By doing so, all online banks that are connected to the payment method Trustly will be presented to the customer.
The customer can finalize the payment by logging in with the banking details.

### Transaction flow
The transaction flow shows the different ways a transaction can be processed. This differs per payment method.

* Order status      
The order status indicates the status of the order, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. The order status is independent of the incoming or outgoing payment of the transaction.

* Transaction status       
The transaction status indicates the payment status of the transaction, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. Once the transaction status is _completed_, the amount of the transaction is added to your MultiSafepay balance.

| Order Status | Transaction Status | Description                                                                                                                       |

| Completed    | Completed        | A successful Trustly transaction has been received and the funds will be added to your MultiSafepay Control balance.              |

| Void         | Cancelled        | Transaction has been cancelled.                                                                                                   |
