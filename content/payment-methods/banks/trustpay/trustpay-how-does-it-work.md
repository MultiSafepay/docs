# How it works
If the transaction is approved by TrustPay, the transaction status will change to _completed_ and MultiSafepay will add the funds to the balance of your MultiSafepay Control.

## Transaction flow
The transaction flow shows the different ways a transaction can be processed. This differs per payment method.

* Order status      
The order status indicates the status of the order, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. The order status is independent of the incoming or outgoing payment of the transaction.

* Transaction status       
The transaction status indicates the payment status of the transaction, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. Once the transaction status is _completed_, the amount of the transaction is added to your MultiSafepay balance.


| Order Status | Transaction Status | Description                                                                                                          |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialized  | Initialized      | A payment link has been generated, but no payment has been received yet.                                             | 
| Completed    | Completed        | A successful Alipay transaction has been received and the funds will be added to your MultiSafepay Control balance.  |

| Expired      | Expired          | An unfinished transaction will automatically expire after a predefined period.                                       | 
| Void         | Cancelled        | Transaction has been cancelled.                                                                                       |

## Product Rules
Some rules may apply to certain payment methods. For TrustPay, the following rules apply:

* Refunding more than the stated amount of the original transaction is possible with TrustPay. More information is available on our [refund more than original amount](/faq/finance/refund-more-than-original-amount/) page

* Successful TrustPay transactions have no expiring date regarding refunding, as long as the receiving bank is able to process the refund

* As a direct banking payment method, TrustPay has a different payment flow and therefore the setting of days or seconds active will have no influence. The customer processes the payment from his/her own banking environment. Full documentation can be found on our [lifetime of a payment link](/faq/api/lifetime-of-a-payment-link/) FAQ page

* As it is a standard bank transfer method, an expiry date exception for TrustPay transactions has been set to 10 days

* TrustPay transactions are processed in [Czech Koruna (CZK)](/faq/general/which-currencies-are-supported-by-multisafepay/).
