# Security check upon delivery

To ensure the secure handling of your customers' card data, it is highly recommended to inspect your terminals for any signs of tampering.

Steps to follow:

1. Verify that the plastic cover around the terminal box is undamaged.
2. Compare the device you received with the image of the device you ordered.
3. Check the weight of the terminal to ensure no unauthorized objects, such as in the battery compartment, have been added.

## Connect to a Wi-Fi network

To connect to a Wi-Fi network:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Network & Internet** > **WLAN**
2. Select your Wi-Fi network.

For more information about Wi-Fi connection, refer to the manual provided with the terminal.

# Connect to the Smartpad

Smartpad is a cable-powered terminal that must be connected to a power cable.

To enhance network stability, we recommend that you connect the Smartpad to a network cable.

***

# Manage battery

If your battery is not charging, ensure that you are using a USB-C cable that is properly connected to the power source.

***

# Print receipts

To print your receipt, you need a thermal printer roll of either 57mm or 58mm.

***

# Serial number

You can find your serial number (for SmartPOS / Sunmi)

* on the device: some models display the serial number on the back of the terminal.
* in the MultiSafepay app: go to **Settings** > Menu > **About** > scroll to the bottom
* in the Sunmi settings app: location depends on the Android version, for example under **Model and hardware** / **About device**

# Turn on the terminal

* Charge the terminal for at least 30 minutes.
* Press and hold the power button for a few seconds to switch it on.

**⚠️Note:** The terminal will reboot every 24 hours counting from the first time it was powered on, to ensure optimal performance and stability.

For more information, see the manual provided with the terminal.

***

# Update firmware

An outdated version of the firmware can cause miscellaneous issues.\
Always ensure to run your device on the latest available version.

Via the Sunmi portal,

1. Go to **Device** > Device upgrade > Upgrade management

2. Remove the data filter

3. If there is new firmware available, the **Add to Upgrade Group** button will be highlighted.\
   Adding a terminal to the update group means the terminal will detect new firmware and will start downloading.

**💡 Tip!** Make sure to unpack and activate the terminal so you can add it to the upgrade group.

4. Download will start automatically.\
   By default, the download limit is set to 20KB/sec. You can increase this on the terminal itself in the **System update app**, ideally via the partner portal to apply it to all terminals.

5. Upon successful download, reboot the terminal to install the newly downloaded firmware.

6. You can automate this in the partner portal via\
   Device > Device Upgrade > **Important package configuration**

Steps on the device:

1. **Reboot** via the button on right of the device
2. Settings (terminal) > About device > (select model)
3. You can view your current version, and **check update**.
