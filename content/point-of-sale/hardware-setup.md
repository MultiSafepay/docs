## Update firmware

An outdated version of the firmware can cause miscellaneous issues.
Always ensure to run your device on the latest available version. 

Via the Sunmi portal, 

1. Go to **Device** > Device upgrade > Upgrade management

2. Remove the data filter

3. If there is new firmware available, the **Add to Upgrade Group** button will be highlighted. 
Adding a terminal to the update group means the terminal will detect new firmware and will start downloading.

Tip: Make sure to unpack and activate the terminal so you can add it to the upgrade group.

4. Download will start automatically. 
By default, the download limit is set to 20KB/sec. You can increase this on the terminal itself in the **System update app**, ideally via the partner portal to apply it to all terminals. 

5. Upon successful download, reboot the terminal to install the newly downloaded firmware.

6. You can automate this in the partner portal via 
Device > Device Upgrade > **Important package configuration**


Steps on the device:

1. **Reboot** via the button on right of the device 
2. Settings (terminal) > About device > (select model)
3. You can view your current version, and **check update**.
