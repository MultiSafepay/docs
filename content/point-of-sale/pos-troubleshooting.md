# Connection

 The internet connection appears to be unstable or disconnected.

### Manage the internet connection

When the internet connection isn't working correctly: 

- Check if your Wi-Fi router is connected correctly and the network is stable.
- If the terminal is not connected to the Wi-Fi, see - [How to connect to Wi-Fi](/manage-my-account#how-to-connect-to-wi-fi).
- If the Wi-Fi is connected, check the color of the internet icon on your terminal.

# Activation

The terminal is not correctly onboarded or linked with the correct group.

## Onboard the terminal

If you haven't activated your terminal, follow these steps: 

<details id="activate-terminal">
<summary>How to activate terminal</summary>

<br>

- [Traditional (CTAP) terminal](doc:traditional-ctap-terminal)
- [SmartPOS activation](doc:smartpos-activation)

If your SmartPOS terminal isn't onboarded correctly, email <pos-support@multisafepay.com>

> **Note:**
>
> To help us resolve the issues faster, provide us with the following:
> - Account ID
> - Terminal serial number
> - Description of the issue
> - If available, pictures or video
>
</details>

## No **Devices** visible in Merchant dashboard 

If you cannot see the **Devices** section in your Merchant Dashboard yet

- check if your user has the correct permissions, or contact your administrator.
- contact us via support@multisafepay.com.

## MultiSafepay app not visible 

Apps need to be whitelisted in the Sunmi account linked to the device. 

## Incorrect API key

If you have used an incorrect API key for cloud payments, check for the correct API key in your dashboard. 

<details id="transactions">
<summary> How to retrieve API key</summary>

1. Sign in to your MultiSafepay dashboard.
2. Go to **Devices** > **Terminals**, and then click **Manage groups**.
3. In the **Manage groups** dialog, hover over the key icon.

</details>

## IPEK not configured

Before you begin activation, ensure that the Initial PIN Encrypted Key(IPEK) is registered on your terminal.

To check if IPEK is correctly registered, turn on your terminal and view the **Configured** field.

If your IPEK is **not** configured, you can 

- attempt manual configuration via **Settings** > Advanced > Security Center > Key Injection > RKI > Key Inject
- contact us via <pos-support@multisafepay.com> 

With a soft decline, you first receive a notification with an order status of declined. Once the customer completes the required verification (e.g., enters their PIN), you'll receive another notification. If successful, the order status will be completed. If the payment fails, the order status will be cancelled.

## Logs

Retrieving logs can be a helpful step to investigate an issue. You can generate them via your Sunmi portal:

- Go to Device > **Log task management**
- Clear _start time_
- Press **New task**
- Ensure to select **syslog** and add serial numbers
- Define the timeframe during which the logs should be uploaded to the portal and replicate the issue during this time. _Start time \_must be later than \_current time_. 
- Click **release**

# Sunmi system keyboard 

## Manual Input
When using **Manual Input** for the first time on the **SUNMI P2 SE** model, the default system keyboard will be displayed instead of a numeric keypad.

To fix this, at the **Manual Input** screen, click the **keyboard** icon in the bottom corner and choose the language you selected during the initial device setup. This will display the numeric keypad.

## Enabling the on-screen keyboard for the P2 Smartpad
After the initial setup or reset of your **P2 Smartpad**, you will need to manually enable the on-screen keyboard through the MultiSafepay app:

1. Click the input field where you want to enter text(e.g., the order ID field). A new keyboard icon will be displayed in the navigation bar.
2. Click the **keyboard** icon.
3. Choose a language and click the **Show virtual keyboard** toggle.
4. The alphanumeric keyboard will be displayed on the screen. Enter your text. 
5. Click **Done**. The input field will be populated with your text.

**‚ö†Ô∏èNote:** The keyboard icon appears only for input fields that accept letters and numbers.

# Payment errors

The terminal isn't working correctly, payment information isn't displayed or payment is declined.

## Order placed - not shown on terminal 

Checks you can do:

- Is the terminal connected to wifi?
- Did you use the correct API key for your terminal group? 

## Declined payment

If your payment is declined, check if you encountered any error messages.

| Error status | Solution |
| :---         | :---     |
| Configuration error. Try again | Send a request to  <pos-support@multisafepay.com> |
| Card not supported | Send a request to  <pos-support@multisafepay.com>|
| Use a different interface | Initiate the transaction again. <br>  Ask the customer to insert the card instead of doing a contactless payment. |
| 1000 card declined | Contact support@multisafepay.com to confirm payment method configuration. |
| Use Magstripe | Contact pos-support@multisafepay.com |

Additional check: ensure that you did not deactivate any card payment methods in your Merchant Dashboard.

## Soft declines for SmartPOS payments
When using <a href="https://docs.multisafepay.com/docs/webhook" target="_blank">webhook notifications</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i> or <a href="https://docs.multisafepay.com/docs/event-notifications" target="_blank">event notifications</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>, you might encounter **soft declines**. A **soft decline** occurs when an initial payment attempt is declined, requiring the customer to take further action, such as entering their PIN, often for larger amounts.

With a soft decline, you first receive a notification with an order status of declined. Once the customer completes the required verification (e.g., enters their PIN), you'll receive another notification. If successful, the order status will be completed. If the payment fails, the order status will be cancelled.

**‚ö†Ô∏èNote:** A soft decline is not a final payment status. Proceed with the payment process until the status is **canceled** or **completed**.

# Errors in the display of the app / screen

2. Navigate to Settings > System > About
3. Scroll down to the **TUSN** button 
4. Press the TUSN button 8 times (alternative: SV button)

2. Select **P Serial Tamper** and follow the steps in the Sunmi environment.<br>**üí° Tip!** prepare a picture of your device to attach to the form. 
3. Depending on the error code, you will receive a code to unblock your device. 

Once the terminal is rebooted, the device is ready for use again.
