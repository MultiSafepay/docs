# Connection

 The internet connection appears to be unstable or disconnected.

### Manage the internet connection

When the internet connection isn't working correctly: 

- Check if your Wi-Fi router is connected correctly and the network is stable.
- If the terminal is not connected to the Wi-Fi, see - [How to connect to Wi-Fi](/manage-my-account#how-to-connect-to-wi-fi).
- If the Wi-Fi is connected, check the color of the internet icon on your terminal.

- Clear _start time_
- Press **New task**
- Ensure to select **syslog** and add serial numbers
- Define the timeframe during which the logs should be uploaded to the portal and replicate the issue during this time. _Start time \_must be later than \_current time_.

# Set device to developer mode

Note: once a device is converted to developer mode, it cannot be reverted. This means it will no longer be PCI compliant.

1. Request TUSN code from Sumni.
2. Navigate to Settings > System > About
3. Scroll down to the **TUSN** button 
4. Press the TUSN button 8 times (alternative: SV button)
5.  Enter the code received from Sunmi.  
   The 4-digit code is valid for 24 hours.


# Tampering alarm

If your device has been blocked due to the error on screen "Attacked! Please contact your service provider", you can reach out to Sunmi for support. 

1. On the <a href="https://www.sunmi.com/en-US/" target="_blank">Sunmi page</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>, go to *Contact Technical Support* > Create new request.
2. Select **P Serial Tamper** and follow the steps in the Sunmi environment. 
Tip: prepare a picture of your device to attach to the form. 
3. Depending on the error code, you will receive a code to unblock your device. 

Once the terminal is rebooted, the device is ready for use again. 
If the alarm reoccurs within a short time frame, a sensor might be damaged. You can contact us for assistance via [pos-support@multisafepay.com](mailto:pos@multisafepay.com).
