# User guide

Check the settings available in your MultiSafepay dashboard below.

## Terminal groups

A terminal group is required for linking and activating a SmartPOS device. You can create a single group or multiple groups for segmentation. Each terminal group is assigned a unique **API key** and **ID**. All transactions processed by terminals within the same terminal group are consolidated under a single reconciliation history.

This functionality offers reconciliation, reporting and management for single and multiple terminal groups.

### How to create a terminal group

To create a terminal group:

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MultiSafepay dashboard</a>.
2. Go to **Devices** > **Terminals**.
3. Click **Manage groups**.
4. Click **+ Add new group**.
5. Insert a name for your group, and optionally, a [logo](activation/user-guide#how-to-upload-your-logo) to enable branding, and a [Webhook](doc:webhook) URL to receive updates for your payments.
6. Click **Create**.

**‚ö†Ô∏èNote:** Individual terminals within a same group cannot have different images. Add different terminal groups and add a logo for each group.

Your new terminal group will be added to the **Manage groups** list. A terminal group ID and an API key will be associated.

To view the ID and API key for a terminal group:

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MultiSafepay dashboard</a>.
2. Go to **Devices** > **Terminals**.
3. Click on **Manage groups**.
4. A list of all available terminal groups will be displayed, showing the ID and API key for each group.

* Change the **name** of the terminal group.
* Change the logo by selecting a different image file.
