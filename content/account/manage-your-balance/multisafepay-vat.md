For payment methods where MultiSafepay is the collecting party, we are required to charge VAT on all: 

- Transaction fees – charged as each transaction is processed
- Bank fees – charged at the beginning of each month
- Payout and refund fees 

We automatically deduct total VAT from your MultiSafepay balance at the end of each month. 

To view the exact amount in your MultiSafepay account > **Transaction overview**, enter 'VAT' or 'Invoice' as a search query. 

{{< details title="More about transaction fees" >}}
&nbsp;  
The transaction fee total is the sum of all processed and completed transactions within a specified timeframe and the (universal) transaction fee agreed when you created an account with MultiSafepay.

## VAT invoices
We upload monthly VAT invoices to your MultiSafepay account > **Finance** > **Invoices**. The invoices are for your records only. You **don't** need to pay the amount separately.

{{< details title="Financial email address" >}}
&nbsp;  
We also email the invoices to the **Financial email** address in your MultiSafepay account. If you have not added an email address here, we send them to the main business email address provided in your account.

To add a financial email address, go to **Contact Information**.

{{< details title="Shifting VAT" >}}

If you provide us with your local VAT registration number to include in your monthly invoice, standard Dutch VAT of 21% can be shifted and won't be charged to you.

{{< details title="Refunds" >}}

There are two entries for refunds on your VAT invoice: one for payment methods for which MultiSafepay is the collecting party, and the other for payment methods for which we are not.

{{< details title="Non-collecting payment methods" >}}

For payment methods where we are **not** the collecting party:

- VAT is applied via the scheme to avoid double taxation. 
- Transactions are listed on your invoice with zero VAT value.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Exchange rates" >}}

We always use our bank's closing exchange rate from the previous day. The exchange rate is not displayed on the invoice, but it is easy to calculate.

Simply divide the EUR amount by the foreign currency amount (or the other way around depending on your target currency).

## Reverse-charging VAT
You can only request to reverse-charge VAT if you are **not** registered as a Dutch company. You must also register your VAT number with MultiSafepay.

To register your VAT number, email the Finance Team at <invoice@multisafepay.com>
