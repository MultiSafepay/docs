The [daily balance report](/faq/finance/viewing-your-daily-balance/) now includes the balance of [Uncleared transactions](/faq/finance/evaluating-uncleared-card-transactions/). 

This is particularly useful if you offer [pay later](/payments/methods/pay-later/) and/or [credit card](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/) payment methods. 

To activate the Uncleared balance feature in your daily balance report, email an application to your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

To view your daily balance report:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Finance** > **Daily balance**.
