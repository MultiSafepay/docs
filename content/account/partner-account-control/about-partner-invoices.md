MultiSafepay sends you partner invoices for the previous month, including:

- Invoice date: the date you receive the invoice and VAT for the previous month
- Invoice period: the month of the commission payout
- Payout fee: payouts from your MultiSafepay balance to your business bank account cost 0,50 EUR each
- Your monthly commission payout (excluding VAT)
- VAT (21%): refunded to your account

Partner invoices are for your records only. You **don't** need to pay anything.
