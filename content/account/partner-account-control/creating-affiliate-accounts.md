To create accounts for affiliates, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your partner account.
2. Go to the affiliate dashboard, click **Affiliates**. 
3. In the affiliate dashboard in the top-right corner, copy the **Partnerlink** and send it to your affiliates.

## Onboarding and go live
All affiliates must be [onboarded](/getting-started/go-live/) and sign an agreement with MultiSafepay, containing general terms and conditions.

You can also onboard affiiates [via our API](/account/api-onboarding/).

For any questions, affiliates can email <partner@multisafepay.com>
