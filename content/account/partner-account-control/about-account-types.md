[Partner](/getting-started/glossary/#partner-account) and [merchant](/getting-started/glossary/#merchant) accounts each represent a single legal entity that processes payments. They can support multiple:

- Bank accounts
- Users with their own login credentials and permissions

Partner accounts act as a parent to affiliated merchant accounts and may receive commissions. For more information about commissions, see [Managing commissions](/tools/partner-account-control/managing-commissions).

If you currently have a merchant account, contact your account manager to discuss your options. 
If you don't have a MultiSafepay account, [sign up for a partner account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup?partner).
