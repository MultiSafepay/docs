You can manage affiliated MultiSafepay accounts through the affiliate dashboard. 

Once an affiliate is approved, to access their account, click the blue **Sign in** button that appears in the **Action** column for that merchant.

The dashboard provides an overview of the affiliate's finances, transactions, settings, reports, and tools. You can also process refunds or carry out technical integrations.
