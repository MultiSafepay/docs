Some payment methods you must apply to your account manager to activate, others you can activate yourself. Check the relevant [payment method](/payments/methods/) under **Activation**.

To activate payment methods in your MultiSafepay account:

{{< activate_payment_method name="" >}}

Next, enable the payment methods in the [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend) of your integration to finalize the connection.
