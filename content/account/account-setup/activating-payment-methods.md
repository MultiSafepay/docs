All your websites:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Payment methods**.
2. Under **Standard payment methods**, select the relevant checkbox(es).
3. Click **Save changes**.

A specific website, if you manage multiple websites that support different payment methods:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Website settings**.
2. Click the relevant website to open the **Website settings** page.
3. Under **Payment methods**, select the relevant checkbox(es).
4. Click **Save**.
**Note:** Make sure you enable the payment methods for every relevant website in your account.

Next, enable the payment methods in the [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend) of your integration to finalize the connection.
