PrivatePay lets you choose not to display your company name on customers' bank statements, or to display an alias instead. Customers may prefer this if you offer "adult" products. It can be set at website level, or for specific transactions. 

To activate PrivatePay, email a request to the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>

**Note:** It may take 24 hours after approval to take effect.
