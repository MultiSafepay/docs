You can process payments in a large number of currencies, provided that they are:

- Supported by the specific payment method.
- Enabled in your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) and in the settings of any plugins.
- Correctly processed in the transaction [API request](/api/#orders).

## Enabling currencies in your MultiSafepay account

To view the currencies currently enabled in your MultiSafepay account, go to **Finance > Balance**.

To enable new currencies in your MultiSafepay account, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>

You must also add a business bank account that supports the currency to your MultiSafepay account. Follow these steps to ensure transactions can be processed in that currency and no conversion is required:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Finance > Balance > Add bank account**.
3. Process a bank transfer in the new currency to confirm the business bank account.

Once your new business bank account has been approved by the Risk Team, you can process payouts without currency conversion.

## Converting currency in your MultiSafepay account

To convert other currencies to Euros (EUR)in your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), go to **Finance > Currency conversion**.
