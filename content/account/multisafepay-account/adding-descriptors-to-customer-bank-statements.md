To add descriptors (e.g. your company name) on customer bank statements to identify transactions, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Website settings**.
3. In the **Name** field, enter your company name.
4. The descriptor appears.

You can adjust the descriptor for the following payment methods:

- **iDEAL** → (trade name) via MultiSafepay
- **Bancontact** → 
- **Direct Debit** → MultiSafepay (account holder name)
- **Credit Cards** → Legal name known to MultiSafepay
- **Sofort** → MultiSafepay

**Note:** Descriptors can be a maximum of 35 characters.
