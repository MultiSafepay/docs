You can sign up for a MultiSafepay account while still using another PSP without incurring any costs. A test account lets you process test payments and gives access to all features. MultiSafepay only starts charging monthly fees when you onboard, go live, and begin processing real payments. 

### Transferring tokens
In collaboration with your current PSP, we can securely transfer tokenized credit card details. This is especially useful if you process recurring payments or want to offer existing customers the option of reusing their credit card details.
