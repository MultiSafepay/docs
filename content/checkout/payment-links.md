You can manually generate a link to a [payment page](/docs/payment-pages/) to pass to a customer to complete payment. 

# How it works

Use cases include:

- A customer wants to adjust an existing <<glossary:order>> and instead of starting over with a new order.
- You need to create a <<glossary:transaction>> for a manually generated order.
- MultiSafepay collects a payment for an amount that doesn't match any order. If you accept the payment, you need to manually generate a payment link and email it to <support@multisafepay.com>
- A [bank transfer](/docs/bank-transfer/) transaction has expired.

# Activation

No activation is required.

# Integration

You can generate payment links via the API:

- API reference â€“ [Create order](/reference/createorder/) > Payment page/link
- API recipe â€“ [Create a payment page/link](/reference/createorder/)

Or via your dashboard:

## Link lifetimes

The lifetime of a payment link is how long it remains active for the customer to access the payment page and complete payment. The default is 30 days.

<details id="how-to-adjust-link-lifetimes">
<summary>How to adjust link lifetimes</summary>
<br>

To set or adjust the lifetime of a payment link, see API reference â€“ [Create order](/reference/createorder/): `days_active` parameter.

ðŸ“˜ **Note:** This is different to [transaction expiration times per payment method](/reference/transaction-expiration/). 

This only applies to certain payment methods:

| Adjustable | Non-adjustable |
|---|---|
| Banking methods, except direct debit | Direct debit |
| Gift cards | Edenred, Paysafecard |
| Wallets | PayPal â€“ Links are valid for 14 days. The lifetime is set by PayPal. |
| Credit cards |  |

</details>

## Number of attempts

The customer can open the link to the payment page up to 20 times, after which the link is disabled.

Each attempt creates a new <<glossary:transaction>> with the same `order_id`. If the customer completes payment in one of these transactions, the [status](#overview-and-statuses) of the other transactions changes to **Duplicate**.

## Overview and statuses

<details id="overview-and-statuses"> 
<summary>Overview and statuses</summary>
<br>

For an overview of all payment links:

1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
2. Go to **Transactions** > **Payment links**.

| Payment link status | Description |
|---|---|
| Active | The customer hasn't paid yet. | 
| Canceled | You canceled the link.|
| Completed | The customer has paid. |  
| Duplicate | The customer completed payment in a duplicate transaction. |
| Expired | The link lifetime has expired. | 

</details>

## Payment methods

<details id="supported-payment-methods">
<summary>Supported payment methods</summary>
<br>

**All** payment methods are supported. 

The payment page displays **all** payment methods activated for the relevant site. If you want to display specific payment methods, you need to create a new site profile with only the relevant methods activated. 

</details>
