FastCheckout is MultiSafepay's own complete checkout solution for a fast, frictionless checkout experience and increased <<glossary:conversion>>.

## How it works

FastCheckout is highly flexible and fully customizable. It consists of modular checkout steps (billing, shipping, and payment) that let you create a tailored experience for each customer. 

New features and payment methods are made available automatically. No updates or upgrades are required. FastCheckout is optimized for both mobile and desktop.

The FastCheckout page comprises 4 elements that can be displayed or hidden, and configured per transaction.

You can also include custom fields, e.g. terms and conditions, newsletter signup.

#### Billing element

- Gathers the customer's billing information
- Auto-highlights any incorrect or incomplete details

#### Shipping element

- Gathers the customer's shipping address
- Displays available shipping options
- Supports multiple carriers, pickup locations, and standard and express options
- Automatically updates the order total with any shipping fee 

#### Payment element

- Dynamically displays payment methods based on the customer's country, device, and the order amount
- Styles how <<glossary:issuers>> are displayed and how to connect to their environment
- Validates input instantly and suggests actionable errors
- Saves space by bundling all available credit cards in a single gateway that auto-detects the card type
