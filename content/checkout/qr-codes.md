QR payments have a wide range of applications as codes can be read off screens or paper, e.g. invoices, receipts. Customers can change the amount to pay and the same QR code can be used more than once. This makes them particularly suitable for charity collectors, home deliveries, and the hospitality industry (to avoid queuing or waiting to pay). 

Customers can scan merchant-generated QR codes with the built-in camera in their smart device, or merchants can scan customer-generated codes with an adapted barcode reader. It's a great way to accept payments without requiring a card machine or other expensive equipment.

Payment is quick, automated, and secure.
