# Create affiliate accounts

To create a new affiliate account in your dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [partner/primary account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).
2. Go to the affiliate dashboard, and then click **Affiliates**. 
3. In the affiliate dashboard top-right corner, copy the **Partnerlink** and send it to your affiliates.
4. To customize a welcome email, go to **Settings** > **Email templates**.
5. Click **Add new template** > **Load default template**.
6. Edit the template and fill out the fields as required.

# Onboard affiliate accounts

All affiliates must [onboard](/docs/onboarding/) and sign an agreement with MultiSafepay, containing general terms and conditions.

You can also automate onboarding affiliates [via our API](/docs/affiliate-onboarding-api).

For any questions, affiliates can email <partner@multisafepay.com>

# Access affiliated accounts

To access an affiliate's account:

1. Sign in to your [partner/primary account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).
2. Under the **Action** column for the relevant merchant, click **Sign in**.

Here you can manage: 

- Account ID and settings
- Company name and business model
- Registration data
- Phone number, email address
- Screening status and actions
- Technical integrations, reports, and other tools
- Transactions, refunds, and balance

# Charge affiliates

You can charge affiliates at three levels.

| Account level | Charge |
|---|---|
| **Partner/primary level** | Set fixed or percentage-based transaction charges for **all** affiliated merchant accounts. |
| **Affiliate level** | Set fixed or percentage-based transaction charges for a specific affiliated merchant account. <br> This overrides the partner/primary-level settings. |
| **Transaction level** | [Split incoming payments](/docs/split-payments/) between multiple merchant and/or partner accounts. <br> You can use this feature for both partner/primary and affiliate-level charges.|
