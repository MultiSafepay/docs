A partner account is the account of a company that is not itself a merchant, but refers affiliated merchants to MultiSafepay on commission.

Affiliated merchants are referred to MultiSafepay and controlled by a primary merchant account or a partner account.

Partner and [merchant](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#merchant) accounts each represent a single legal entity that processes payments. They can support multiple:

- Bank accounts
- Users with their own login credentials and permissions

Partner accounts act as a parent to affiliated merchant accounts and may charge them. For more information, see [Charging affiliates](/account/charging-affiliates/).

If you currently have a merchant account, contact your account manager to discuss your options. 
If you don't have a MultiSafepay account, [sign up for a partner account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup?partner).
