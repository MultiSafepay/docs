MultiSafepay may request a deposit to cover our financial risks, e.g.:

- A merchant goes bankrupt and we can't collect funds for chargebacks from their account.
- A merchant uses payment methods that let you withdraw funds from your MultiSafepay balance when there are no funds available, e.g. SEPA direct debits or credit card payments. 

Deposits are based on various factors:

* Credit card volume
* Delivery timelines
* Financials
* Performance and experience

If financials are requested, we request your most recent balance sheet, and profit and loss statement.
