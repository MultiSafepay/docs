## Two-factor authentication
    
 Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an optional, additional layer of security for data in your MultiSafepay account. It is supported in every country.

When enabled, users must verify their identity with a password, and a 6-digit token generated in the user's MultiSafepay mobile app for **every** sign in.

- You can only connect a mobile device to **one** user, and each user to only **one** mobile device.
- After 5 unsuccessful token inputs, the user's account is blocked and can only be unblocked by an administrator. 
- If a user loses their 2FA device, disable and re-enable 2FA on their account.
