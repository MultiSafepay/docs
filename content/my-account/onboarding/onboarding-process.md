Onboarding is the process of MultiSafepay checking and approving information submitted by merchants and partners applying for a live account.

To onboard with MultiSafepay and start processing real transactions, follow these steps:  

## 1. Submit sign up form

Complete and submit the live account [sign up form](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup).

We'll create a live account and email you a security code to sign in to your [live dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).

## 2. Provide company information

1. [Sign in](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) to your dashboard.
2. Under [Business details](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/onboarding), provide your:
    - Company address
    - VAT number
    - Chamber of Commerce number
    - Business bank account number (must exactly match at least one of the trade names listed on your Chamber of Commerce extract)
3. Add the URL of at least one website you accept payments through, or select the **I don't have a website** checkbox.

If you provide a URL, you can now start receiving payments into your MultiSafepay balance. However, you cannot pay funds out to your business bank account until the onboarding process is completed. 

We may then ask you to provide additional documents, e.g. if you have an unusual company structure.

{{< blue-notice >}} You must inform us if [your company details change](/account/changing-company-details/). {{< /blue-notice >}}

### Credit card payments
If you want to process credit card payments, provide your:

- Minimum, average, and maximum order value
- Annual turnover from credit card transactions

**Note:** Requests to process credit cards may be denied, e.g. if you sell [prohibited products/services](/account/prohibited-products-services/).

### Products and services

Provide information about what products and services you sell. Some products and services can't be sold with MultiSafepay, or only if additional requirements are met. 

For more information, see:

- [Prohibited products and services](/account/prohibited-products-services/)
- [Conditions for selling alcohol](/account/conditions-for-alcohol/)

### Pre-screening

We pre-screen your account to check if the products/services you sell are low, medium, or high risk. Payments for medium and high-risk products/services are pauzed until onboarding is complete. 

## 3. Validate bank account

Validate your business bank account by either:
- Making a payment of 1 EUR from the account, **or** 
- Providing a copy or screenshot of a bank statement that includes your IBAN and company name

## 4. Identify UBOs

1. Complete a Statement of ultimate beneficial owner form to identify the [ultimate beneficial owners](/account/ubo/) (UBOs) of your company.
