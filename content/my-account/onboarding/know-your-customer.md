As a [payment service provider](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-service-provider-psp) and [acquirer](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#acquirer), MultiSafepay is legally required to perform know your customer (KYC) checks.  

You need to provide information about your company structure, and your products and services. We then perform KYC checks on the:

- Account holder
- Business bank account
- Merchant
- Website

To help you start accepting payments as quickly as possible, we divide our KYC checks into two phases:

- **Identification:** As soon as we have established the identity of the account holder, you can start accepting payments.
- **Verification:** As soon as we have verified the identity of the account holder, you can start making [payouts](/account/payouts/) to your business bank account.
