You can sign up for a MultiSafepay account while still using another PSP without incurring any costs. A test account lets you process test payments and gives access to all features. MultiSafepay only starts charging monthly fees when you onboard, go live, and begin processing real payments. 

### Transferring tokens
In collaboration with your current PSP, we can securely transfer tokenized credit card details. This is especially useful if you process [recurring payments](/features/recurring-payments/) or want to offer existing customers the option of reusing their credit card details.
