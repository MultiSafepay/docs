To set up your account, you must add at least one site (e.g. a website, app, or other application), for which we generate an API key. 

# How it works

You can add an unlimited number of sites to your MultiSafepay account, but they must all be operated by the same legal entity linked to that account.

To process payments from a site operated by a separate legal entity, you must sign up for an additional MultiSafepay account.

# Activation

2. Go to **Settings** > **Website settings**.
3. Click **Quick add site**.
    - From the **Category** list, select what type of products or services your site sells.
    - In the **Description** field, enter the site name.  
    **Note:** If relevant, this is displayed on MultiSafepay payment pages and the customerâ€™s bank statement.
    - In the **Base URL** field, add the siteâ€™s URL. This must be the URL where you receive payments.
    - If you want to receive [status updates](/payment-statuses/) via webhook, in the **Notification URL** field, enter a URL for us to send them to.
4. Click **Save**.
    A **Website settings** page for the new site displays, which you can configure as needed.

# Integration

To connect a site to your <<glossary:backend>>, enter the required details: 

- Most [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/): Your [site ID, API key, and secure code](#site-id-api-key-and-security-code), and account ID (top-right corner of your dashboard)  
- Self-made integrations: Your [site API key](#site-id-api-key-and-security-code)

The connection is finalized. To validate the connection, [place a test order](/docs/testing/).
