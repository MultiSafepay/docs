## Account types

Check which type of account best fits your company:

    id1(Do you work with other companies that you charge fees to?)--> id2 & id3
    id2(No= Merchant account)
    id3(Yes. <br> Do you receive part of the MultiSafepay <br> transaction fee from your affiliated companies?)--> id4 & id5
    id4(No= Primary account, <br> e.g. marketplaces, franchises, crowdfunding)
    id5(Yes= Partner account, <br> e.g. digital agencies, SaaS companies)

All account types represent a single legal entity, but can support multiple bank accounts and users with their own login credentials and permissions.

## Creating an account

You can create a live account and start the [onboarding process](/getting-started/guide/#5-onboard-your-account) straight away.

Or, you may want to first create a test account. This is a free account where you can build and test your integration, explore payment features, and process test transactions. You can then onboard your account to start processing real payments. 

**1.** Fill out the relevant signup form: 

|   |  |  | 
|---|---|---|
| Merchant account | [Live signup form](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup) | [Test signup form](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup) |
| Partner/primary account | [Live signup form](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup?partner) | [Test signup form](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup?partner) |

You receive an email containing your **security code**. 

**2.** Use your security code to sign in to your account: 

- [Live account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) 
- [Test account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/) 

**3.** Live accounts open by default to the onboarding steps page. You can navigate away from this page, and return to it via the button under **Alert**.

**4.** For partner/primary accounts, an account manager contacts you to confirm the appropriate account structure for your needs, and guide you through the [onboarding process](/getting-started/guide/#5-onboard-your-account).
