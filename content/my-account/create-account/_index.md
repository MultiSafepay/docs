    id1(Do you work with other companies that you charge fees to?)--> id2 & id3
    id2(No= Merchant account)
    id3(Yes. <br> Do you receive part of the MultiSafepay <br> transaction fee from your affiliated companies?)--> id4 & id5
    id4(No= Primary account <br> E.g. marketplaces, franchises, crowdfunding)
    id5(Yes= Partner account <br> E.g. digital agencies, SaaS companies)

All account types represent a single legal entity, but can support multiple bank accounts and users with their own login credentials and permissions.

## Creating an account

You can create an account and start the [onboarding process](/getting-started/go-live/) straight away.

Or, you may want to first create a test account. This is a free account where you can build and test your integration, explore our features and tools, and process test transactions. You can then onboard to start processing real payments. 

Fill out the relevant signup form: 

|   |  |  | 
|---|---|---|
| Merchant account | [Onboarding signup form](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup) | [Test signup form](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup) |
| Partner/primary account | [Onboarding signup form](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup?partner) | [Test signup form](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup?partner) |

You'll receive an email containing your **security code**. Use this code to sign in to your account: 

- [Onboarding accounts](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) 
- [Test accounts](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/)
