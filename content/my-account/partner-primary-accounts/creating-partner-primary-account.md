## Onboarding and go live

To make pay outs to your business bank account, you must onboard your account and go live. Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your partner/primary account.
2. Click **Go to activation**.
3. Upload the following documents:
    - A copy of a certified Chamber of Commerce extract (not older than six months)
    - A copy of a valid ID of the directors and/or ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) – persons with an interest of 25 percent (or more) in the company e.g. via shares, control or profit.
    - A copy of your company’s’ bank statement from your online banking environment, including your IBAN and company name. **Note:** The company name on your bank statement must match the company name on the Chamber of Commerce extract.
4. Transfer a payment of 1 EUR from your business bank account (you can also do this from your MultiSafepay account).

It takes around 3 business days for MultiSafepay to screen, approve, and activate your account. Your account manager will contact you to configure the required settings for your account.
