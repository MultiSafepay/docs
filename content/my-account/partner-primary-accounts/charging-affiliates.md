You can charge affiliates at three levels:

- **Partner/primary level**: Set fixed or percentage-based transaction charges for **all** affiliated merchant accounts.

- **Affiliate level**: Set fixed or percentage-based transaction charges for a specific affiliated merchant account. This overrides the partner/primary-level settings.

- **Transaction level**: [Split incoming payments](/payments/features/split-payments/) between multiple merchant or partner accounts. You can use this feature for both partner/primary and affiliate-level charges.
