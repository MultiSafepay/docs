Partners can charge affiliates at three levels:

- **Partner level**: Set fixed or percentage-based transaction charges for **all** affiliated merchant accounts.
- **Affiliate level**: Set fixed or percentage-based transaction charges for a specific affiliated merchant account. This overrides the partner-level settings.
- **Transaction level**: [Split incoming payments](/payments/features/split-payments/) between multiple merchant or partner accounts. You can use this feature for both partner and affiliate-level charges.
