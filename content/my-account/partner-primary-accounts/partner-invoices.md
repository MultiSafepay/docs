MultiSafepay sends partner invoices for the previous month. 
These invoices are for your records only. You **don't** need to pay anything.

The invoices include:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoice date** | The date you receive the invoice and VAT for the previous month. |
| **Invoice period** | The month of the commission payout. |
| **Payout fee** | [Payouts](/account/payouts/) from your MultiSafepay balance to your business bank account cost 0,50 EUR each. |
| **Monthly commission payout** | This excludes VAT. |
| **VAT (21%)** | This amount is refunded to your balance. |

To request an invoice, email <partner@multisafepay.com>

{{< blue-notice >}}**Note:** Primary accounts don't receive partner invoices. They receive [MultiSafepay VAT invoices](/my-account/manage-your-balance/multisafepay-vat/), like merchant accounts.
