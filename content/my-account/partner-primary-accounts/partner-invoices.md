MultiSafepay sends you partner invoices for the previous month, including:

- Invoice date: The date you receive the invoice and VAT for the previous month
- Invoice period: The month of the commission payout
- Payout fee: [Payouts](/account/payouts/) from your MultiSafepay balance to your business bank account cost 0,50 EUR each
- Your monthly commission payout (excluding VAT)
- VAT (21%): refunded to your account

Partner invoices are for your records only. You **don't** need to pay anything.

To request an invoice, email <partner@multisafepay.com>

{{< blue-notice >}}**Note:** Primary accounts don't receive partner invoices. They receive [MultiSafepay VAT](/my-account/manage-your-balance/multisafepay-vat/) invoices like merchant accounts.
