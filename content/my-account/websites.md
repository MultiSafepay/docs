To set up your account, you must add at least one website, for which we generate an API key. 

# How it works

You can add an unlimited number of websites to your MultiSafepay account, but they must all be operated by the same legal entity linked to that account.

To process payments from a website operated by a separate legal entity, you must sign up for an additional MultiSafepay account.

# Activation

1. Sign in to your MultiSafepay dashboard. 
2. Go to **Settings** > **Website settings**.
3. Click either:  
    
  <details id="quick-add-website">
  <summary>Quick add website</summary>
  <br>

  4. From the **Category** list, select what type of products or services your website sells.
  5. In the **Description** field, enter the website name.  
      **Note:** If relevant, this is displayed on MultiSafepay payment pages and the customerâ€™s bank statement.
  6. In the **Base URL** field, add the websiteâ€™s URL. This must be the URL where you receive payments.
  7. If you want to receive [status updates](/payment-statuses/) via webhook, in the **Notification URL** field, enter a URL for us to send them to.
  8. Click **Save**.

  Or, for more advanced configuration:

  <br>

  1. Enter the website URL in the **Full website URL** field, or select it from the **Select existing site** list, and then click **Continue**.
  2. From the **Website platform** list, select your ecommerce platform.  
      You are prompted to install the MultiSafepay ready-made integration for your ecommerce platform in your website. 
  3. From the **Category** list, select the type of products and/or services you sell from this website, and then click **Continue**.
  4. If you want to receive [status updates](/about-payments/multisafepay-statuses/) via webhook, in the **Notification URL** field, enter a URL for us to send them to.
  5. In the **Description** field, enter your company name, and then click **Continue**.  
      **Note:** If relevant, this is displayed on MultiSafepay payment pages and the customerâ€™s bank statement.  
      A template of your [payment page](/payment-pages/) is generated.
  6. Customize the template as required.  
      - To toggle the view of the payment page, click:
          - **List view** to see all payment methods in a list
          - **Detail view** to display one detailed box for entering payment details and collapse all other payment methods
          - **API view code** to view the code
      - To replace the MultiSafepay logo in the top-left corner, after completing the wizard, upload your own logo under **Settings** > **Payment page templates**.
      - To hide the MultiSafepay logo in the top-left corner, on the lefthand side under **Settings**, select the **Hide main logo** checkbox.
      - On the lefthand side, under **Header**, **Body**, **Container**, **Cart**, **Payment form**, and **Buttons**, you can change the color of the background, text, lines, and links in different parts of the payment page.
      - To clear your changes and start again, click **Reset style**.
  7. To set this payment page as your default template, select the **Set as default template** checkbox. 
  8. In the **Save template as** field, enter a name for this template.  

  Your account is now linked to your website.
