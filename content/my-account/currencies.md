You can process payments in a large number of currencies. When customers can pay in their preferred local currency, it increases their trust in your site and therefore your <<glossary:conversion rate>>.

For all supported currencies, see [Payment methods per currency](#payment-methods-per-currency) below.

# How it works

To accept payments in a currency other than the default (EUR), the currency must be:

- Supported by the payment method
- Enabled for your account 
- Supported in your <<glossary:backend>>
- Correctly processed in the [create order](/reference/createorder/) request

> ‚Ñπ Note
> If the currency the customer wants to pay in is **not** supported by a payment method, the payment method does not appear in your checkout. 

## Payouts

You can [make payouts](/docs/payouts/) in: 

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| AUD Australian dollar | EUR Euro | PLN Polish z≈Çoty |
| CAD Canadian dollar | GBP British pound | SEK Swedish krona |
| CHF Swiss franc | HKD Hong Kong dollar | USD United States dollar |
| DKK Danish krone | NOK Norwegian krone |  |

If you receive funds in any other currency, you need to convert them to a payout currency to pay them out. 

‚ùóÔ∏è MultiSafepay applies a 4% conversion fee. 

## Business bank account

You must also add to your account a business bank account that supports the currency so that no conversion is required there:

## Account balances

When a transaction is initiated for a currency enabled for your account, we automatically create a separate balance for it in your dashboard. This provides a clear overview of your currencies and makes them easier to manage.

## Example

<details id="example-scenario">
<summary>See an example scenario</summary>
<br>

1. You have EUR, GBP, and BRL enabled for your account and supported in your <<glossary:backend>>.
2. A Brazilian customer wants to pay in BRL via Visa. Visa supports BRL.
3. Based on the customer's country, you display prices in BRL and at checkout, the payment page displays BRL. The customer feels as if they are paying in their local currency.

4. You receive the funds in the BRL balance in your dashboard.

## Zero-decimal currencies

JPY is a **zero-decimal currency**.
For decimal currencies, you provide the amount in cents, e.g. value for 10 EUR = **1000**. 
For zero-decimal currencies, you must provide the whole value only, i.e. value for ¬•10 = **10**.
