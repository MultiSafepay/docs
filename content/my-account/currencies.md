# How it works

You can process payments in a large number of currencies, provided that they are:

- Supported by the specific payment method
- Enabled in your dashboard and in the settings of any [ready-made integrations](/integrations/ready-made/)
- Correctly processed in the [create order](https://docs-api.multisafepay.com/reference/createorder) API request

# Activation

To view the currencies currently enabled for your account, in your dashboard go to **Finance > Balance**.

To enable new currencies, email <support@multisafepay.com>

You must also add a [business bank account](/invoices/) that supports the currency. Follow these steps to ensure transactions can be processed in that currency and no conversion is required:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Finance > Balance > Add bank account**.
3. Process a bank transfer in the new currency to confirm the business bank account.

Once your new business bank account has been approved by the Risk Team, you can process payouts without currency conversion.
