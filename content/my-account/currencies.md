# How it works

You can process payments in a large number of currencies, provided that they are:

- Supported by the specific payment method
- Enabled in your dashboard and in the settings of any [ready-made integrations](/docs/our-integrations/)
- Correctly processed in the [create order](/reference/createorder/) API request

# Activation

To view the currencies currently enabled for your account, in your dashboard go to **Finance > Balance**.

To enable new currencies, email <support@multisafepay.com>

You must also add a business bank account that supports the currency so that no conversion is required:

<details id="how-to-add-business-bank-account">
<summary>How to add a business bank account</summary>
<br>

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Finance > Balance > Add bank account**.
3. Process a bank transfer in the new currency to confirm the business bank account.

Once your new business bank account has been approved by the Risk Team, you can process <<glossary:payouts>> without currency conversion.
