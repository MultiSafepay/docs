# Merchant/primary account VAT invoices

Merchant and primary account holders receive a monthly invoice for the total amount of VAT we deduct from your account balance at the end of each month.

For payment methods where MultiSafepay:

- Collects, we are required to charge VAT on processing fees.
- Does **not** collect, VAT is applied via the scheme to avoid double taxation. These transactions are included in invoices with zero VAT value.

## Exchange rates

We always use our bank's closing exchange rate from the previous day.  
The exchange rate is not displayed on the invoice. 

To calculate the rate, simply divide the EUR amount by the foreign currency amount (or the other way around depending on your target currency).
