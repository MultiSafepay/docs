A payout is when you transfer funds from your account balance to your business bank account.

You can make payouts any time for 0,50 EUR each.

<details id="supported-currencies">
<summary>Supported currencies</summary>
<br>

You can make payouts in: 

- AUD (Australian dollar)
- CAD (Canadian dollar)
- CHF (Swiss franc)
- DKK (Danish krone)
- GBP (Pound Sterling)
- HKD (Hong Kong dollar)
- NOK (Norwegian krone)
- PLN (Polish zÅ‚oty)
- SEK (Swedish krona)
- USD (United States dollar)

</details>

# Processing times 
The time taken to process payouts is determined by the Risk Team. The default payout delay is 1 day. 
Payouts may take up to three business days to arrive in your business bank account.

Payment batches are not processed on weekends. That is, payouts initiated on Fridays are processed on Monday morning.

Not all banks support instant payments and therefore may take extra time to process payments.

### Bank holidays

MultiSafepay pays out every business day of the year, but **not** on bank holidays. Delayed payouts are made the next business day. 

Check the dates of local bank holidays. They may change each year.

### Automatic payouts

Assuming default settings, if you schedule a payout on Monday, the payout batch includes all payments up to 23:59 hours on the Monday night. The payout batch is sent to MultiSafepay's bank on Tuesday morning. Our bank processes the batch and transfers the pay out to your business bank account. You should receive the payout on Tuesday afternoon.

### Manual payouts

The status of the pay out is **Reserved** for 24 hours before it is added to our bankâ€™s payout batch in the morning. Then, the payout is transferred to your business bank account. Manual payouts usually take longer to process than automatic ones.

# Exclusions

You cannot make payouts if:

- Your MultiSafepay account is not yet fully activated.

    <details id="how-to-resolve-account">
    <summary>How to resolve</summary>
    <br>

    You can process payments immediately after creating a MultiSafepay test account and adding your site. But MultiSafepay holds your funds in your account balance until your account is fully activated.

    To check if your account is fully activated, follow these steps:

    1. Sign in to your <a href="https://merchant.multisafepay.com" target="_blank">MultiSafepay dashboard</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:12px;color:#8b929e"></i>.
       If your account is not fully activated, on the dashboard home page, under **Alerts**, a message appears that your account is incomplete. 
    2. Click **Go to activation**.

    We check and approve your account details and the information on your site. Once approved, we will send you an email that your account is fully activated. 

    </details>

- Your account balance is negative.
    
    <details id="how-to-resolve-balance">
    <summary>How to resolve</summary>
    <br>

    If your account balance is negative (e.g. due to refunds, chargebacks, or fees), payouts are paused until enough funds are available. 

    Always set a "reserved balance" in your payout settings to prevent payout and/or refund delays.
    </details>

- Your payouts are deactivated.
