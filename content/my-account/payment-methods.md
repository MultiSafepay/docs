Some payment methods you can activate yourself in your dashboard, but for some you need to apply to MultiSafepay first. Other methods with specific requirements follow their own activation flow.  

| Activation flow | Payment methods |
|---|---|
| [Apply to MultiSafepay](#apply-to-multisafepay) then activate in dashboard | Credit and debit cards and wallets (**except** PayPal), direct debit, Dotpay, in3, Pay After Delivery |
| [Activate in dashboard](#activate-in-dashboard) | Banking methods, E-Invoicing   |
| [Own flow](#own-flow) | Betaal per Maand, Klarna, Edenred, gift cards, Paysafecard, PayPal, Riverty |

### Ready-made integrations

If you use a [ready-made integration](/docs/our-integrations/), first check that the payment method is supported. 
Once the method is activated, also enable it in your <<glossary:backend>>.
