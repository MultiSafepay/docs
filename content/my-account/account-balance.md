# Daily balance

To view your daily balance in your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), go to **Finance** > **Daily balance**.

There you can see your:

- Balance and closing balance date
- Bank description
- IBAN and Swift
- Payout amounts and payouts sent to the bank
- Transactions and statuses
- Uncleared balance (if activated, see below)

# Uncaptured balance

You can set your daily balance report to include the balance of uncleared transactions. This is particularly useful if you offer <<glossary:BNPL>> and/or credit card payment methods.
