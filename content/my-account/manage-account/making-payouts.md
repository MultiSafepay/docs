A payout is when you transfer funds from your MultiSafepay balance to your business bank account.

You can make payouts any time for 0,50 EUR each.

## Business bank accounts
As part of your onboarding, you specify a business bank account to pay out to. 

{{< details title="Add additional bank accounts" >}}
To add additional bank accounts to your account (once fully onboarded), follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com). 
2. Go to **Finance** > **Bank accounts**.
3. Click **Add new bank account**.
3. Fill in the:
    - **Account holder name**
    - **IBAN**
4. From the **Currency** list, select the currency of the bank account.
5. Click **Save**.
6. To verify the account, on the **Business bank account** page either:
    - Make a payment of 1 EUR from the business bank account via iDEAL or Bank Transfer to your MultiSafepay balance, **or**
    - Upload a copy of a bank statement. Select the file, and then click **Upload**.
    **Note:** The company name on the bank statement must exactly match one of the trade names on your Chamber of Commerce extract.

MultiSafepay verifies the bank account within 5 business days. We **only** accept business bank accounts (no private bank accounts) that are registered to your official company name.

- AUD (Australian dollar)
- CAD (Canadian dollar)
- CHF (Swiss franc)
- DKK (Danish krone)

- HKD (Hong Kong dollar)
- NOK (Norwegian krone)

## Payout processing times 
The time taken to process payouts is determined by the Risk Team. The default payout delay is 1 day. Payouts may take up to three business days to arrive in your business bank account.

Payment batches are not processed on weekends. That is, payouts initiated on Fridays are processed on Monday morning.

Not all banks have instant payments and therefore may take extra time to process payments.

{{< details title="Bank holidays" >}}

On some bank holidays, banks don't process outgoing payments. 

MultiSafepay pays out every business day of the year, but **not** on bank holidays. Delayed payouts are made the next business day. 

Check the dates of local bank holidays. They may change each year.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Processing time for automatic payouts" >}}
&nbsp;  
Assuming default settings, if you schedule a payout on Monday, the payout batch includes all payments up to 23:59 hours on the Monday night. The payout batch is sent to MultiSafepay's bank on Tuesday morning. Our bank processes the batch and transfers the pay out to your business bank account. You should receive the payout on Tuesday afternoon.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Processing time for manual payouts" >}}
&nbsp;  
The status of the pay out is **Reserved** for 24 hours before it is added to our bank’s payout batch in the morning. Then, the payout is transferred to your business bank account. Manual payouts usually take longer to process than automatic ones.

## Exclusions

You cannot make payouts if:

{{< details title="Your MultiSafepay account is not yet fully activated" >}}

You can process payments immediately after creating a MultiSafepay test account and adding your website. But MultiSafepay holds your funds in your MultiSafepay balance until your account is fully activated.

To check if your account is fully activated, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. Go to **Finance** > **Payouts**.
3. If your account is not fully activated, a red bar appears at the top of the screen with a link to the page where you can upload the documents required to approve your account.

The Risk Team then checks and approves your account details and the information on your website. Once approved, we will send you an email that your account is fully activated. 

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Your MultiSafepay balance is negative" >}}
&nbsp;  
If your MultiSafepay balance is negative (e.g. due to refunds, chargebacks, or fees), payouts are paused until enough funds are available. Always set a "reserved balance" in your payout settings to prevent payout and/or refund delays.

{{< details title="Your payouts are deactivated" >}}
