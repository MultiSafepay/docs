This page describes invoices MultiSafepay generates for your records at month end.  
You do **not** need to pay them separately. 

## Merchant/primary account VAT invoices

Merchant and primary account holders receive a monthly invoice for the total amount of VAT we deduct from your MultiSafepay balance at the end of each month.

For payment methods where MultiSafepay [collects](/glossaries/multisafepay-glossary/#collecting-party), we are required to charge VAT on processing fees.

For payment methods for which we do **not** collect, VAT is applied via the scheme to avoid double taxation. These transactions are included in invoices with zero VAT value.

To view VAT invoices in your MultiSafepay dashboard, go to **Finance** > **Invoices**.

| Type of fee | When charged |

| Payout fees | During processing |
| Refund fees <br> (Separated into collecting and non-collecting orders) | During processing |

**Note:** The transaction fee total is the sum of all processed and completed transactions within a specified timeframe _plus_ the universal transaction fee agreed when you created an account with MultiSafepay)

### Non-Dutch merchants 

If you are **not** registered as a Dutch company, you can request to shift standard Dutch VAT of 21% so that it's not charged to you. 

You must provide us your local VAT registration number. Email <invoice@multisafepay.com>

### Exchange rates

We always use our bank's closing exchange rate from the previous day.  
The exchange rate is not displayed on the invoice. 

To calculate the rate, simply divide the EUR amount by the foreign currency amount (or the other way around depending on your target currency).

## Partner invoices

Partner account holders receive invoices for total monthly:

- Payout fees (0,50 EUR per [payout](/account/payouts/))
- Commission fees from affiliated merchants
- VAT (21%) â€“ This amount is refunded to your balance

To request an invoice, email <partner@multisafepay.com>
