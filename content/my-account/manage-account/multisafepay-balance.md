## Viewing your daily balance

To view your daily balance in your [MultiSafepay dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), go to **Finance** > **Daily balance**.

There you can see your:

- Balance and closing balance date
- Payout amounts, transactions, and status
- Payouts sent to the bank
- Bank description
- IBAN and Swift
- Uncleared balance â€“ If activated, see below.

## Viewing your uncleared balance

You can set your daily balance report to include the balance of uncleared transactions. This is particularly useful if you offer [pay later](/payment-methods/pay-later/) and/or [credit card](/payment-methods/credit-debit-cards/) payment methods. 

To activate this feature in your daily balance report, email a request to <sales@multisafepay.com>
