# Account types

There are three types of account: 

- Merchant
- Partner
- Primary

All account types represent a single legal entity, but can support multiple bank accounts and users with their own login credentials and permissions.

Check which type of account best fits your company:

# Test accounts

You may want to start with a test account. This is a free account where you can build and test your integration, explore payment features, and process test transactions. You can then create a live account and [onboard](/docs/onboarding/) to start processing real payments.

To create a free test account:

- Fill out the [signup form](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup).
- Sign in to your [test dashboard](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com) using the security code we email you.

# Live accounts

To create and [onboard](/docs/onboarding/) a live account and start processing real payments, follow these steps: 

1. Fill out the relevant signup form: 

    | Account type | Live | Test | 
    |---|---|---|
    | Merchant | [Signup form](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup) | [Signup form](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup) |
    | Partner/primary | [Signup form](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup?partner) | [Signup form](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup?partner) |

    You receive an email containing your **security code**. 

2. Use your security code to sign in to your account: 

    - [Live account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) 
    - [Test account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/) 

3. Live accounts open by default to the onboarding steps page. You can navigate away from this page, and return to it via the button under **Alert**.

4. For partner/primary accounts, an account manager contacts you to confirm the appropriate account structure for your needs, and guide you through the [onboarding process](/docs/onboarding/).  

# Switching to MultiSafepay from another PSP

You can sign up for a MultiSafepay account while still using another PSP without incurring any costs. 

A test account lets you process test payments and gives access to all features. MultiSafepay only starts charging monthly fees when you onboard, go live, and begin processing real payments. 

## Transferring tokens
In collaboration with your current PSP, we can securely transfer tokenized credit card details. This is especially useful if you process [recurring payments](/docs/recurring-payments/) or want to offer existing customers the option of reusing their credit card details.
