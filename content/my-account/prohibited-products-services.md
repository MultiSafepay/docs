As a payment service provider, MultiSafepay is subject to Dutch and European legislation and regulations. We must also comply with specific policies set by each payment method we offer. 

We must account for risk and potential reputational damage. Therefore, we prohibit the sale of some products and services, or require additional information from the merchant.

# Alcohol

MultiSafepay has an obligation to ensure you comply with relevant legislation and that your customers meet the requirements for purchasing alcohol.

Dutch law states that alcohol cannot be sold to customers under the age of **18**. You must verify customers' age when selling or delivering orders that include alcohol. When orders are delivered, customers must show a valid identification document with their date of birth, e.g.:

- Passport
- Dutch driving license
- European or Dutch ID card

If you sell alcohol, you must:

- State this clearly on your website.
- Email a signed declaration about alcoholic beverages (once only) to <risk@multisafepay.com>
