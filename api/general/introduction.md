Welcome to the MultiSafepay API reference (JSON gateway)!

To test using the API sandbox, you need to [create a test account](/docs/create-account/).

Direct vs redirect
------------------

With our API, you can create transactions through direct and redirect requests.

Direct requests connect directly to the payment method, whereas redirect requests first send the customer to a [payment page](/docs/payment-pages/).

For redirect requests, if the gateway for a specific payment method is:

- Provided: The payment page is tailored for that payment method, e.g. for Visa, the page includes fields for the customer to enter their credit card details. 
- Not provided: The payment page displays **all** payment methods.

Then, if further customer action is:

- Required: The customer is redirected to complete payment, e.g. for iDEAL, they are redirected to their online banking environment. 
- Not required: The transaction is completed automatically. 

If you provide a `redirect_url`, after completing payment the customer is directed to your success/thank you page.

For more information about the direct and redirect flows for a specific payment method, see the payment method page.
